<p class="indent">No character in this book, belonging either to public or
private life, is taken as a whole or in part from any person.
The characters are wholly imaginary, and no incident is
based on any real incident known to the writer. Even in
the descriptions of official buildings, memory is laxly used.
In the genre studies alone is realism attempted. Most, if
not all, of the questions, remarks, and speculations put into
the mouths of peasants and servants have been overheard
by the writer.</p>

<p class="h1">THE<br />
BREATH OF THE GODS</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> stone dwelling of Senator Cyrus C. Todd, usually as
indistinguishable from its neighbors as is one piano key from
another, presented at nine o&#39;clock on this night of November
third, nineteen hundred and three, a claim to individuality in
the excess of light pouring from every window, from the perpendicular
wink of every opening door (opened but to close
again as quickly); oozing, it would seem, from the very pores
of the pale façade, thereby giving to the great flat rectangle
of the house a phosphorescent value that set it six feet out
into the night.</p>

<p class="indent">The upper windows shone more brilliantly than those below.
A roller shade had been carelessly left high. Through the
film of chamber curtains heads could be seen passing. Once,
there was the outflung gesture of a slim, bare arm. Everything
bespoke approaching festivity. At this brightest window
a silhouette suddenly appeared, sharp, dark, complete.
It was that of a Japanese girl with wonderfully looped and
curved coiffure, shoulders that sloped tenderly, and a small,
straight throat.</p>

<p class="indent">Just at this moment, on the shadowed entrance-steps below,
answering silhouettes began noiselessly to climb. These
were men with thin black legs, and strange burdens, black
like themselves. They showed angles as of gnarled roots;
one, the great curved body of a gigantic spider. The front
door, opening instantly to a ring, disclosed them merely as
musicians,&mdash;Signor Marcellini of Milan and his colleagues,&mdash;bearing
basso, cello, and flutes, secure in swart cases.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
The lower rooms of the house were slightly chill. Though
flooded with soft light, they were not yet fully illuminated.
All doors within stood open. It looked almost as if walls had
been taken down, so long and mysterious had grown the vistas.
Through all tingled an aromatic smell, something a little alien,
like crushed herbs,&mdash;pungent, and full of vague suggestion.
Mrs. Cyrus C. Todd, flowing now down the palm-set stairway
in a purple tide of skirts, frothed with dim lace, stopped at a
switchboard half concealed in vines, sent forth a gloved, determined
hand, and in an instant the secret of the odor was
revealed. The rooms, to their farthest angles, literally exuded
chrysanthemums. Senator Todd was said to have expended
five thousand dollars for these flowers alone. Perhaps
he wished to stamp in gold upon the memory of Washington
this coming-out party of his idolized, only child. The conceit
was fair enough, for Gwendolen was bright, and blonde, and
golden in herself. Statesmen and the wives of statesmen did
not fail to observe that chrysanthemums were the insignia of
official Japan, and that November third happened,&mdash;they
emphasized &quot;happened,&quot;&mdash;to be the birthday of Japan&#39;s beloved
Emperor. These two facts, joined with the third, that
Senator Todd even now had aspirations to the Tokio mission,
made a trio of keen angles to be used as wedges for further
speculation.</p>

<p class="indent">The walls of the lower story had been spread for the occasion
with yellow satin, upon which alternated delicate upright
strokes of silver and of white. Around, under the ceiling,
grew a frieze of living flowers. The great, coarse, woody
stems crossed in a lattice-work, with clusters of huge blossoms
and green leaves breaking the angles at points of decision
possible only to a trained artist, or to a Japanese. The white
duck floor-covering spread to a border hand-painted, to match
the frieze. Where wall and canvas met, the real flowers again
arose,&mdash;thick parallel stalks of differing heights, upholding
a wainscot border of shaggy gold. Mantles were heaped with
them. Japanese pots of them in bloom alternated with conventional
ferns and palms. Each electric bulb jutted from
the heart of a living flower. The very air had an amber tone.</p>

<p class="indent">Overhead, invisible footsteps scurried in short flights. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
sounded feminine, young, full of excitement. &quot;Heavens!&quot;
Miss Gwendolen de Lancy Todd was crying, &quot;where on earth <i>is</i>
my other glove? I am sure I just laid it here! And my
orchids! Has anybody sat on my orchids? I think I&#39;ll have
to marry the young person who sent them, though I forget
now who it was!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A person of the name Dodge, n&#39;est-ce-pas?&quot; ventured the
little French dressmaker, on her knees beside the fair white
vision. Pins, retained at the corners of her mouth, added a
crushed softness to the pronunciation. She rhymed it with
&quot;targe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, a name like that, I believe,&quot; said Gwendolen, indifferently,
and craned her long neck over. &quot;Mother called him
some sort of a snip. Are you certain that my dress hangs
right now, Madame?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oui, oui. It is perfection,&quot; declared Madame, sticking
the remaining pins into the black front of her dress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then at last I am actually ready. I believe there&#39;s
mother calling now. Where did Yuki go? Oh, I see, over
there by the window, as calm and cool as if we were going to
church instead of to our first ball!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then all my coolness is stopping on my outsides,&quot; said the
Japanese girl, with a little incipient shrug and giggle, breaking
at once into the merriest of low laughs. She crossed the
room swiftly, with an unusual, swaying rhythm of movement.
&quot;Ah, Gwendolen, my heart it go like yellow butterflies to be
downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen turned a radiant face to greet her. &quot;Now isn&#39;t
she a vision!&quot; cried the girl aloud, in fresh access of admiration
for her friend. &quot;Madame, what do you think those
French painters of yours would say to her&mdash;Chavannes, De
Monvel, Besnard,&mdash;who owe so much to Yuki&#39;s art?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You omit Monsieur Le Beau, who is a painter,&quot; said the
little woman, shyly. She was on good terms with the girls, and
had made Yuki, as well as Gwendolen, chic gowns with the
breath of Paris upon them. &quot;I knew well the family of
Monsieur Le Beau in France,&quot; she hurried on, seeing the distressed
flush in Yuki&#39;s face. &quot;Non, non, Mamselles. I am a
chattering old femme. Let me look at you together before you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
descend the stair.&quot; She sat back upon her heels to enjoy
the picture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; cried Gwendolen, &quot;that&#39;s right. Take us both in.&quot;
Laughingly she drew Yuki&#39;s arm, with its long, trailing sleeve
of gray, tightly within her own. They rested together, swaying,&mdash;smiling,&mdash;Yuki&#39;s
cheek still warm with the name of
Pierre Le Beau, two types as far apart as the two sides of
earth which had given them race.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen was fair almost to the extreme of golden blondness.
Her features were small and perfectly related; her nose
deliciously interrogative at the tip. Her brows and lashes,
drawn in a darker hue, gave touches of character and distinction.
She was very slender, erect, and was poised as though she
grew in the wind. The long tulle draperies shook and stirred
as if vitalized by her energy. She was all white and gold.
Her heaped-up skeins of hair, amber necklace, gloves, slippers,
and stockings gleamed with a primrose hue, and the
freckles on her orchids (poor flowers, just caught up hastily
from an ignominious corner) repeated the yellow note.</p>

<p class="indent">Beside her, Yuki Onda, a few inches lacking in height, impressive,
nevertheless, and held with a striking yet indefinable
difference of line, smiled out like a frail Astarte. Her pallor
had an undernote of ivory, where Gwendolen&#39;s was of pearl.
Her head, with its pointed chin, bore, like a diadem of jet,&mdash;balanced,
like a regal burden,&mdash;the spread wings of her hair.
Beneath a white, low brow her eyes made almost a continuous,
gleaming line. The little nose came down, straight and firm,
with a single brush stroke. All the humanity, the tenderness,
the womanhood of her face lay in the red mouth and the small,
round chin. Her smile was startling, even pathetic, in beauty.
Gwendolen had once said, &quot;There is sometimes something
in Yuki&#39;s smile that makes me want to fight God for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s robe, in deference to hours of pleading from Gwendolen
and Pierre Le Beau, was Japanese to the least detail.
Mrs. Todd had protested in vain for the &quot;civilized&quot; coming-out
gown of white. The robe hung about the girl in long,
loose folds of crêpe, mist-gray, rising in soft transitions from
the dark band of the hem to pearl tones at the throat. Under
it were garments of heavier silk, dawn-colored, showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
like morning through thin clouds. Into the curdled substance
of the crêpe, cherry-flowers were dyed, or rather,
breathed in, by a smiling, wrinkled brown magician at the rim
of Yuzen Creek,&mdash;pale shapes which glimmered and were
gone, rose to the surface and sank again, as though borne in
moving water. Besides the black note of her hair there was
one strong crash of contrast in the obi, or sash, a broad and
dominating zone, black, too, with fire-flies of gold upon it.
For hair-ornaments she wore a cluster of small pink flowers
that had the look of cherry-blooms, and a great carved ivory
pin, pronged like a tuning-fork, an heirloom in her father&#39;s
family.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendo&mdash;<i>len</i>! Yu-<i>kee</i>! Come down instantly!&quot; rose the
voice of Mrs. Todd. &quot;You should have been down ten
minutes ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Madame Todd calls,&quot; exclaimed the dressmaker,
scrambling to her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you are sure you really admire us, Madame?&quot; challenged
Gwendolen, before she would stir.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oui, charmante, charmante, both are perfection apart&mdash;and
a vision of paradise together. But go, young ladies, the good
mother calls again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The spoiled child stopped for another instant, this time in
the doorway. &quot;All right, mother. Coming this instant!&quot;
she hurled downstairs; then to the little Frenchwoman she
said, &quot;Do not attempt to sit up, Madame. Yuki is to stay all
night, and will help me with the pins. After a glimpse at the
reception and some of the goodies below, you must hurry home
to your little Jeanne. Take plenty of bonbons with you, and
I wish to send that great bunch of daisies, with my love. All
children love daisies, n&#39;est-ce-pas?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last they were off. Madame could hear Mrs. Todd, relieved,
yet petulant, scolding them the whole descending scale
of the stairs. Moving through the perfumed disorder of the
room, Madame sought out the daisies, and, with filling eyes,
whispered aloud in French, &quot;Now may the good God be kind
to that loving heart, and send to it only blessing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stockings, scarfs, fans, underwear,&mdash;a thousand dainty
trifles must be gathered up before the little Frenchwoman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
could give herself consent to go. Madame and Miss Todd had
been kind friends to the widowed exile.</p>

<p class="indent">Far over to one side of the room she stumbled upon a dark
heap that showed gleams of a cherry-colored lining. It
emitted, as if consciously, an aroma, subtle, faint, unforgettable,
strange scented echoes of a distant land. It was Yuki&#39;s
long black &quot;adzuma-coat,&quot; worn from the Japanese Legation,
where Baroness Kanrio and the maids had assisted her to
dress, and which, in this bright room, she had slipped laughingly
to the floor and forgotten. Madame held it out for a
moment. Then she folded and laid it softly on the foot of
the bed. Her expression had changed slightly. As if with
relief, she snatched up a dressing-gown of blue flannel, that
cried &quot;Gwendolen&quot; from every turquoise fold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendolen, where is your father hiding?&quot; demanded
Mrs. Todd, severely, as the two girls reached the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, how should I know? Dad hasn&#39;t worried my mind.
Isn&#39;t Yuki simply a dream of spring?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You forget that I have admired Yuki upstairs,&quot; said the
harassed matron, and turned her back. &quot;There&#39;s another
carriage sounding as if it wanted to stop! Every wheel goes
over my nerve-centre. Cy, <i>Cy</i>&mdash;rus! Where <i>is</i> that wretched
man? The musicians should be playing now. The guests
will pour in any instant. There is a carriage stopping! It
<i>has</i> stopped! Heavens, I shall go mad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall Yuki and I run for the drawing-room, mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, dear. Right under that tallest palm. Be sure to
stand ahead of Yuki. Cyrus! Cy&mdash;<i>rus</i>! Oh, he is never anywhere
when I want him.&quot; Her wails preceded her down the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you looking for me, dear?&quot; asked the senator, innocently,
strolling out in a leisurely manner from his study,
where, against orders, he had been smoking a cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Am</i> I!&quot; panted his wife. &quot;And you&#39;ve been smoking!&quot;
But indignation must be swept aside. &quot;The carriages are
stopping, man! Don&#39;t you hear them? I&#39;ll be in bed for a
month if I live through this night! Start up the musicians,
and join us immediately in the front drawing-room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Musicians,&mdash;musicians?&quot; murmured Cyrus, looking about,
&quot;where are the musicians?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
&quot;Not under the hatrack, nor yet in my china-closet,&quot; cried
his lady, with angry vehemence. &quot;Over there! Yes, there&mdash;where
you saw the piano wheeled this afternoon; behind
that hedge of chrysanthemums!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, there in the duck-shooters&#39; lodge. All right, old
lady. I&#39;ll start &#39;em. Don&#39;t get excited!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Guests now streamed upstairs toward the dressing-rooms.
Signor Marcellini began his most seductive waltz; and the
senator stood beside his heaving spouse just as the first
smiling acquaintance crossed the door-sill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Governor! Ah, my <i>dear</i> Mrs. Jink!&quot; chortled Mrs.
Todd. &quot;This is surely a good omen,&mdash;my daughter&#39;s first
official congratulations to come from you. Gwendolen, let me
present Governor Jink and Mrs. Jink, fresh from our own
dear Western state. Miss Yuki Onda of Tokio, Mrs. Jink,&mdash;Gwendolen&#39;s
most intimate school-friend, and my Oriental
daughter, as I call her. Ah, Sir George! Punctuality is one
of the British virtues. Mrs. Blachouse, my daughter, Miss
Todd.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The reception swung now, full and free, into the sparkling
waters of felicity. Laughter, lights, and the rustling of silken
skirts on inner mysteries of silk; music held back by the
multitudinous small sounds of human intercourse, with now
and then a protesting wail from violins and the guttural short
snore of a cello! Laughter, and the clink of glasses on metal
trays, the scraping of spoons against porcelain, tinkling of
ice in fragile vessels, and incessantly the shuffle of footsteps
on soundless, unseen floors! Perfumes of dying flowers and
foliage, odors of essences, fumes of fresh-cut lemons, and of
wine!</p>

<p class="indent">Outside, at the curbing, a continuous roar and rattling of
carriages went on. The covered entrance-way, like an elastic
tent drawn out, sheltered a thin moving stream of faces.
Behind them the scrape of wheels, stamping of horses, and
vociferous bawling of drivers sent a premonitory tingling
through the blood. At intervals there came the snort and
hiss of that modern Fafnir, the automobile, followed by the
nauseating taint of gasoline.</p>

<p class="indent">To Gwendolen and Yuki it seemed as if the line of visitors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
would never end. &quot;Yuki, Yuki,&quot; whispered the former,
&quot;if they keep popping by like this, each with that wooden
grin, I shall certainly go into hysterics! Did you see how
nearly I broke down in the face of that last fat lady in tight
gray sleeves? She looked like a young rhinoceros in its
little sister&#39;s skin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I no longer perceive anybody at all,&quot; said Yuki, tranquilly.
&quot;I only see the small duck called &#39;oshi-dori&#39; bobbing down,
then up, on the Sumida River.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush!&quot; whispered Mrs. Todd, in evident excitement.
&quot;Here comes the Russian ambassador with his entire suite.
I was wondering whether he would snub us because of the
war-talk, and Yuki, and the chrysanthemums, and the
Mikado&#39;s birthday! Now, girls, smile your sweetest!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the good lady was given a surprise. Yuki leaned back
to touch her arm. At the look of irritated inquiry the Japanese
girl said clearly, &quot;You must excuse me from this, dear
Mrs. Todd; I cannot shake hands with that person. If I
shook, I would be the hypocrite.&quot; Without waiting for permission
or remonstrance, she turned and hurried from the
direction in which the Muscovites now approached. Mr.
Todd, with hand already extended in welcome, saw nothing
of the little by-play. Gwendolen heard, sympathized entirely
with Yuki, but wisely held her peace. Mrs. Todd, after a
gasp of outraged dignity, recalled herself, perforce, for the
new greetings.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki had slipped from the line quietly enough. She
walked away now quite slowly and with apparent calm.
Within, she was turmoil and distress. Had she done right?
Had she offended, beyond forgiveness, her kind friends, the
Todds? But, looking from the opposite point, how could she
touch, even in social insincerity, the hand of a man whom
she felt by instinct to be a subtle enemy of her native land?
This very minister was suspected by many to be one of the
strongest who urged the weak Czar into insult and hostility.
Would Mrs. Todd reprove her publicly? Would Baron
Kanrio, when he heard, defend the childish impulse?</p>

<p class="indent">A greater one than Kanrio would soon be here. In the
agitation of the moment she had forgotten that tremendous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
fact. Prince Haganè, her father&#39;s feudal lord, or daimyo,
often called the &quot;Living War-God of Japan,&quot; was to come,
for a few moments, to this reception, and partly because of
her. A Japanese, no matter how great, seldom neglects the
privileges of humanity. Yuki&#39;s parents had written that the
Prince was to see her, and deliver news. What would he say
now,&mdash;what would her father say,&mdash;if told of this rude and
un-Japanese yielding to a personal distaste? &quot;Yet,&quot; muttered
Yuki to herself, through small clenched teeth, &quot;even
should Lord Haganè himself command me, I think I would
not touch that Russian&#39;s hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Moving forward slowly, but always in a straight line, she
came full against a small white surface on a level with her
face, a thing shield-shaped, and framed in black. It did not
move aside for her, as similar white patches, vaguely seen,
had done. Brought up suddenly, she realized it to be a shirt-front,
and presumably behind the shirt-front there must be a
living man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, beg pardon!&quot; she faltered, shrinking back. &quot;I begs
much pardons, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two eager hands caught her own. A gay, low voice said,
laughing, &quot;I have watched your coming. I willed it. How
straight you sped, you beautiful, strange bird!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Yuki, dazed for the moment, did not answer. She
panted slightly, and tried to draw her hands away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have waited here, by the conservatory door. You must
be tired with standing. Come in with me, and rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still unable to command herself, she let the speaker lead
her into the warm shadows. She hoped he had not seen her
rudeness to the Russian minister. Mrs. Todd swept round an
angry glance just in time to see them disappear.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre Le Beau found a sheltered seat, and gently, yet in a
masterful way, forced her down beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Yuki, but you are beautiful to-night! Was I not mad
enough with love without this new gray snare of mist, these
blossoms drifting along an irresistible tide? It is a lifetime
since I have seen you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The beating of the girl&#39;s heart slowly slackened. &quot;The
lifetime of a flower, then,&quot; she said, smiling upward. &quot;It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
but last night, you know, when we all work so hard with the
decorators and the chrysanthemums.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Last century!&quot; he laughed. &quot;I really exist only in the
moments when I am with you. All else are dungeon hours,
locked with your last &#39;Good-bye.&#39; Do not shrink from me
now, darling. Let me hold you in my arms once this wonderful
night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My hair you will disarrange, and others notice,&quot; she
pleaded, holding him back with one white hand. &quot;And, dear
Pierre, you rumples my mind more than my hair. I must be
calm to-night, and cheerful with many. I am the débutante.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are hard to win,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;but I believe I like
it so. Your Japanese etiquette is a thorny hedge. More
than once I&#39;ve torn my soul upon it. Ah, but even that
could not keep me quite away. You struggled hard, you
elf of pearl and mist, but at last you said you loved me,&mdash;that
you wished to be my wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He brushed away the hand and caught her. She gave a
little shuddering movement in his arms. &quot;That was a terrible,
bold thing for a girl of the samurai class to say. My
heart shake a finger at me yet, that I have confessed so immodest
a thought. I should hereafter be very circumspect
with you, to pay for that bad thing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Circumspect!&quot; laughed Pierre. &quot;Yes, we shall both be
circumspect like this,&mdash;and this!&quot; She wrenched herself
from his kisses, and stood upright in the narrow path. &quot;No,
Pierre; I mean it. Please do not do such things, or my
frightened spirit never will return. I must go to Mrs. Todd;
I fear she is angered.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Angered,&mdash;with you?&quot; asked Pierre, arrested by the
sincerity of the girl&#39;s protest. Yuki turned her head away.
Suddenly he recalled the Russian minister&#39;s approach, and
connected it with Yuki&#39;s flight. He stared at her averted
countenance. &quot;Yuki, did you leave your friends,&mdash;would you
offend them,&mdash;rather than greet the Russian ambassador?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered Yuki, trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">The radiance of Pierre&#39;s face went out, his head sank. &quot;So
that was the reason. You would not touch a Russian! As
you know, my mother is a Russian.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
&quot;Oh, it is not <i>all</i> Russians! Do not think that I would
wound you. Many are good. Mr. Tolstoi, Mr. Wittee, your
honored mother, too, I am sure. They hate, as we, the tyrants
that wish to crush the people, and to bring on this cruel,
unjust war. I saw the petals of our Emperor&#39;s flowers shrivel
as he passed them by! I, too, would have shrivelled,&mdash;my
soul would have turned black,&mdash;at his breath.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No war will come!&quot; cried Pierre, vehemently. &quot;I have
told you this before. I know it from the inside. There will
be no war. Your country will not face Imperial Russia!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If those bad ones push us just too far,&mdash;if they delay
replies, and provoke us just a little more,&mdash;Nippon will fight,
and I think that God will let us win!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Christian God must side with Russia. He cannot
aid a nation that does not believe in him!&quot; Pierre&#39;s eyes
held curiosity and a challenge.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki turned slowly to him, answered the look with sombre
brooding, and then stared upward to where close moisture of
the high glass dome curved space into a frosted shell. &quot;Perhaps,
though,&quot; she said, pausing between each word, &quot;the
Christian God&mdash;believe&mdash;in&mdash;<i>us</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before his surprise found vent her mood and tone had
changed. &quot;But, no, no, Pierre; we talk no more of tragic
things this night, not of war, and hate, and destiny. It is our
ball, Monsieur Pierre Marie Le Beau,&mdash;I begs you to remember
that. And me and Gwendolen are now in society. I am
in society,&mdash;is it not nice? Come, let us return to society at
once.&quot; She caught his arm, laughing, and tried to urge him
from the bench.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You witch of moods!&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Are other Japanese
girls like you? When I hold you closest, then do you seem
most far away. I seize you in a thousand tantalizing forms,
only to fear, each time, that never yet have I seen the real
Yuki. Ah! take me to your land, my love, and make me one
with it. What do I care for war, for Russia, even for France,
if once I could believe you entirely my own? You know I
am fighting hard to sail with you next spring. The French
ambassador here gives me much hope, and in France my
relatives are working.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
&quot;Yes, yes, we shall go together on that great ship,&quot; said
Yuki, soothingly, &quot;and together we shall seek my dear
parents, and ask them for our happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre&#39;s face lighted. &quot;But you will be true to me no
matter whether they give consent or not?&quot; he cried. &quot;Swear
it, Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will be true to you, Pierre,&quot; said Yuki. &quot;You wish to
hear that many times, do you not? But I cannot say I will
marry you without their consent. But they are kind&mdash;they
must like you, Pierre.&quot; She flushed delicately. &quot;We&mdash;we
will make them to say &#39;<i>yes</i>,&#39; Pierre.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still the young man hesitated. &quot;This condition that you
hold so stubbornly is our menace,&quot; he began. &quot;I don&#39;t urge
you to marry me at once, without their good wishes, only to
promise that, after trying in every way to gain them, you will
take your life into your own hands and come to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do we fret and worry about such things so far away?
You will take from me all joy of our party. Will you not
return to the room with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Pierre, seizing a hand in his, &quot;I shall hold you
until this is a bit more clear. No, Yuki&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki,&mdash;Yuki!&quot; came a cautious voice, an echo, it seemed,
to Pierre&#39;s last word. &quot;Where are you? Mother has sent
me here. Prince Haganè asked for you. She says to come
at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let my hand go. I must hurry. It is Prince Haganè,&quot;
whispered Yuki, and, slipping deftly from Pierre, she hurried to
join her friend. He followed quickly, stopped in the doorway,
and stood there, scowling.</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd had thinned. He could see the heads and shoulders
of the two girls moving and whispering together as they
sped. Beyond them, surrounded by his suite of glittering
officials, Spanish-looking men in broadcloth and gold lace,
rose the dark, impressive figure of Prince Haganè. He was
in the dull silken robes of his own land, unornamented but for
a single decoration,&mdash;the highest that a Japanese subject, not
a prince of the blood, had ever received.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre&#39;s first thought was an inconsequent one of childish
irritation that the man bore no marks of age. On the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
hand, no one could have thought him young. The massive
features, bronze in tone, and set in a sort of aquiline rigidity,
the conscious, kingly poise of head and throat rising from deep
brawny shoulders, the stiff black hair, touched evenly throughout
with gray, had none of them the color of youth. Yet
beside him youth looked tame, and old age withered. This
man was on the very summit of life, the central point of
storms, rather than their object. His deep-set eyes gazed
now far beyond to the future, then back into the past, with
equal certainty of vision.</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the great man Haganè&mdash;&quot;Ko-shaku Haganè,&quot;
feudal, not imperial, prince; a title signifying the highest
rank attainable by a subject not descended from the gods.
Native ballads called him the &quot;Right Arm and the Left Ear&quot;
of the Emperor. Woodcuts of his splendid, ugly head, set by
country farmers within household shrines, proclaimed him the
Living War-God of Nippon. His victories and innovations at
the time of the Chinese struggle had spread his fame through
two worlds.</p>

<p class="indent">As Yuki and Gwendolen drew near, Mrs. Todd first perceived
them. &quot;Here they are. Present me first, Cyrus,&mdash;then
Gwendolen, then Yuki,&quot; the matron gave whispered
command. Haganè responded to the first two greetings with
unsmiling courtesy, offering a perfunctory extension of his
thick hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, your Highness,&quot; said Todd, his thin, jovial voice
carrying easily to where Pierre stood, &quot;here&#39;s somebody that
will look more natural. Step up, Yuki-ko. You aren&#39;t
afraid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè had already fixed keen eyes upon the girl. His
hands fell to his sides. A faint smile, merely a gleam on
metal, hurried across his face. Pierre saw his lips move.
Yuki went closer, hesitated, gained courage, and looked up
into the broad face. Pierre saw Mrs. Todd and Gwendolen
exchange smiling glances. Todd threw back his head to
laugh. The smile returned to Haganè, unexpected, intensified,
brilliant, as if a new day had broken. Pierre winced. He
saw Yuki sway again,&mdash;put forth two white hands, falter,
then sink suddenly prone, her palms outspread, her white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
forehead on the floor, her whole slim, crouching body topped
by the great black burden of the sash, instinct with reverence
not far from adoration.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè lifted her immediately, his smile deepening. Mrs.
Todd turned away, embarrassed. The small ripple of excitement
in the onlookers died; but Pierre, with angry eyes,
sought Yuki, and drew her slightly to one side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you are my wife there will be no such ridiculous
kow-towing,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is your friend, Yuki?&quot; asked the great man, stepping
condescendingly near.</p>

<p class="indent">She performed the introduction well, speaking in English
without a tremor of the low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Haganè, speaking also in English, &quot;I am recently
from the country of Monsieur, which, I do not mistake
in conjecturing, is France? Perhaps you are a visitor here,
like myself.&quot; He put out the great hand, and after an imperceptible
hesitation Pierre thrust his own within it. The grasp
turned him pale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Highness is correct in both surmises,&quot; he answered
stiffly; &quot;I am of France, and I am a visitor. At an early
date I anticipate the pleasure of being in your Highness&#39;s
country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed? Pray remind me of this meeting when you arrive,
Monsieur. Shall you sail soon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not for many months, I fear,&quot; said the Frenchman.
&quot;But I shall certainly avail myself of your kind suggestion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s eyes were urging him to go. The girl herself
could not have told why she felt apprehension in the proximity
of these two men. Haganè had never been antagonistic
to foreigners, and she knew that, in Japan, she and
Pierre could not have another friend so powerful. Yet she
was uneasy.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, with a last bow, went. The little episode stirred
him. The thought rushed through him, too, that here was
possibly an invincible friend. He would make the most of it.
Even Yuki&#39;s abject obeisance, which before had stung him,
shone now in the light of desirable dependence on the great
man&#39;s word. Let him, Pierre, secure his appointment, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
with Haganè his friend, the old gods might shake their heads
and growl in vain.</p>

<p class="indent">He went into the street. The long rooms had suddenly
grown too small for his aspirations. One friendly cigarette
was smoked, and then another. Life seemed a jolly thing,
that hour, to Pierre.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Haganè&#39;s</span> entrance had broken the receiving line. He became
at once the personage, the dominating influence. Guests
moved about now, or gathered into little social groups at will.
The long apartment filled evenly, a third to the ceiling, with
a shifting surface of triangles which were shoulders,&mdash;white
shoulders, black shoulders, pink shoulders, sometimes a military
pair of gold-lace shoulders, each pair surmounted by a
head. The rooms, emptying ever, were ever filling, as in some
well-constructed drinking-fountain,&mdash;the very walls soaked
in the hum and timbre of human voices.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen, freed from the thralls of official hostess-ship,
gathered to herself young men in passage, as a spray of
scented golden-rod gathers bees. She had a smile for all, a
witty retort, or an insinuating whisper, followed by a provocative
look. Old maids, and mothers with unattractive
daughters, were wont to call Gwendolen a heartless coquette.
As for the coquetry, it was indefensible; as to the heart,
young men held varying opinions with regard to that coveted
article.</p>

<p class="indent">The social atmosphere, charged with evanescent gayety,
intoxicated her. She felt like a flower held under the surface
of champagne. Through all the glamour spread a tincture of
chrysanthemums. Ever after&mdash;sometimes in lands very far
away from Washington&mdash;the odor of these blossoms had
power to bring before her, as in an illuminated vision, the
yellow walls, the moving heads, and, clearest of all, the slender,
mist-gray figure of Yuki Onda; the delicate, happy face
under the great loops of blue-black hair.</p>

<p class="indent">As Gwendolen talked and strolled, promising a dance to one,
refusing it to another, with unreasoning caprice and the manner
of a young empress, her hazel eyes, under their long lashes,
shot more than once an undetected glance to a certain corner
where, beside a pedestal of drooping fern, stood a lonely guest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
This person was young, good to look at in a buoyant, breezy
sort of way, and of the sex which (alas, yet beyond contesting!)
most keenly interested the fair observer. After such
glances she usually fell to fondling her sheaf of orchids, and
once pressed it up against her face. At this the brown eyes
in the corner gleamed, and took on the alertness of a terrier
whose master snaps a playful finger.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd became solicitous that her guest of honor should
be fed, but hesitated to ask him for fear that her &quot;foreign
food&quot; might prove unpalatable. This apprehension was
finally confided on tiptoe to her lord. &quot;Heavens! Susan,&quot;
said the unfeeling mate, with the twinkle which she dreaded,
&quot;do you suppose a Japanese commissary department has been
trotting beside him through Asia, Europe, Boston, and New
York? Set him before a mess of caviare, lobster à la Newburg,
and extra dry, and see what he does to it. Where did
Gwendolen go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s over there by the punch-bowl, I believe,&quot; responded
Mrs. Todd, in absent-minded fashion. The good lady still
hung, ponderously vague, between her husband&#39;s opinion of
Haganè&#39;s gastronomic culture and her own half-solaced fears.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd craned his neck over the crowd. &quot;Oh, there she is,
just by the punch-table. The young men are thicker than
fleas on a candy kitten. Wonder whether it&#39;s Gwennie or
the punch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little of both, I presume,&quot; said Mrs. Todd, austerely.
She often found her spouse unsympathetic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t blame &#39;em then,&mdash;dinged if I do,&quot; cried he, with
a joyful, premonitory lurch. A firm hand clutched him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going for the prince now. He is talking to Yuki.
Shall I send her away? She looks as she did on confirmation
day, the little idiot. The way these Japanese worship their
country and each other is simply ridiculous. What do you
think about keeping her with me and the prince, Cy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd glanced at Yuki. His face softened. She had indeed
an upraised, glorified look, as if a beatified vision instead of a
very solid living man leaned down to her words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep her, by all means. She&#39;ll know how to wait on her
bronze idol,&quot; said he, lightly, and dived into the crowd.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
Apart from Yuki, Mrs. Todd found unexpected solution in
her task of feeding the lion. His private secretary, Mr. Hirai,
was not merely an Oxford graduate, but an accomplished man
of the world. He made everything easy. At the hostess&#39;s
first hint of invitation the Japanese started in a solid body
toward the supper-rooms. Several ladies who had met members
of the party in Boston or New York adhered, smiling,
to the moving group. Yuki fell back with the secretary, and
began chattering to him in Japanese, her dark eyes slowly
turning to stars, her pale cheeks kindling into rosy fire. All
of the company centred about Haganè, as thoughts centre
about a master will. The occasion which Mrs. Todd dreaded
proved to her one of the pleasantest incidents of the whole
successful affair. Haganè, in his enjoyment of the delicate
fare, entirely justified his host&#39;s prophecy. The true hostess
is never quite so happy as when she sees her guests enjoying
the good things which she, through anxious hours, has been
solicitous in providing.</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime Mr. Todd had reached his daughter. The young
men drew back a little in deference to the age and relationship
of the intruder, but did not get beyond range of allurement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s come, little girl,&quot; he whispered, with eyes as young
and bright as hers. &quot;It came by wire just a few minutes ago.
It&#39;s here!&quot; He tapped significantly at the left side of his
coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The appointment? Oh! does mother know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet,&quot; admitted the senator, with the look of an urchin
caught stealing jam. &quot;Perhaps we&#39;d better&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You bet we&#39;d better!&quot; She threw back her head and
laughed the merriest laugh in all the world. Then she ran her
sparkling eyes about the circle of withdrawn, boyish faces.
&quot;You must excuse me; dad has a secret, and that means
insanity for me if I can&#39;t hear it at once. You wouldn&#39;t
have me go mad&mdash;now, would you?&mdash;before the first waltz
plays!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not!&quot; laughed the chorus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Miss Gwendolen,&quot; ventured a bold swain, &quot;how
about that first waltz? For whom are you keeping it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said the girl, pausing, and letting shy archness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
possess her downcast lids, &quot;I did not want to tell you, but
since you force me to it,&mdash;I am keeping the first waltz for&mdash;mother!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With another laugh, full of bright mockery, she caught her
father&#39;s arm, and hurried him away. The excitement of the
past hour was nothing to what she now felt. Chattering,
sparkling, laughing, tossing, gesticulating at times with her
sheaf of flowers, she was a slim fountain of youth, with a noon-day
sun above it. &quot;You really have the appointment!&quot; she
cried to him, when they were well out of hearing. &quot;I knew you
must get it, though the President certainly took his time.
And we shall sail next spring with Yuki! What! we go <i>before</i>
next spring? Oh, how perfectly delicious! And mother
doesn&#39;t know? Now, dad, I am surprised at you! You must
be sure to let mother know first, or her feelings will be hurt.
Oh, aren&#39;t we a pair of rascals, dad? Such nice rascals! I
do like ourselves,&mdash;now don&#39;t you, dad?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre Le Beau had, a few moments before, abandoned his
lonely sentinelship at the conservatory door; but, in the corner
where the fern stood, the sturdier watcher, brown of face
and square of shoulder, held a tenacious post. A deflection of
visual lenses (though to outward appearance his eyes seemed
clear enough) kept him from beholding more than one person
in the crowded rooms. If she had been aware of the silent
challenge, her knowledge was cleverly concealed. Yet now,
on her father&#39;s arm, she drifted steadily, though with seeming
unconsciousness, toward that special nook. The watcher put
a hand on a Roman chair beside him, suggestively unoccupied.</p>

<p class="indent">Abreast of the little group,&mdash;the gold chair, great fern, and
dim inhabitant&mdash;Gwendolen stopped. A smile went forth that
lit the shadows, as she said quite clearly, &quot;Thank you, I believe
I will. I should like to get a bit of a rest before dancing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Senator Cyrus C. Todd did not lack intuition. &quot;Ah, there&#39;s
Skimmer. Very chap I wanted to see!&quot; he mumbled to himself,
and hurried off in an opposite direction.</p>

<p class="indent">He of the brown eyes leaned confidently down. &quot;You chose
my flowers!&quot; he vaunted.</p>

<p class="indent">Exultation was not the most desirable note to adopt with
Gwendolen. She answered nothing for a moment. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
busy adjusting herself to an &quot;unconscious&quot; pose, as perfect as
the bold lines of the chair and her own graceful figure could
combine to produce. She looked down upon the orchids with
a thoughtful, pensive gaze, then slowly upward to the speaker.
&quot;Ah, was it then&mdash;you&mdash;who sent them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; didn&#39;t you know? Was it too cheeky, having met
you but a glorious once?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No reply. Gwendolen lifted the flowers and brushed her
soft lips across them. Her companion drew himself erect
among the drooping green shadows of the fern, swallowed
hard, and asked, in a chastened voice, &quot;Did that bloomin&#39;
blot of a florist forget to put my card in, after all I said?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen&#39;s upraised eyes were now those of a commiserating
dove. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I did not see any card among
the flowers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fern had a short ague and stood still. &quot;I&#39;ll take a surgeon
along when I go to see that florist.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t,&quot; said the girl, pityingly. &quot;It was the loveliest
sheaf I ever saw. He deserves something better than
broken bones for arranging it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, they were jolly. They must have pleased you,&quot; said
the young man, with a wintry gleam of resignation. &quot;I was
bent on finding something that really looked like you. I went
all over Washington, New York, and Philadelphia in person.
But I was so careful of the card! I told the foo&mdash;the man,
over and over again, to be sure and enclose it. It was printed
out in full,&mdash;&#39;T. Caraway Dodge, First Secretary of American
Legation, Tokio, Japan.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think you have found something that looks just like
me?&quot; asked the girl, slowly, ignoring the latter half of his
speech. Her face was full of deprecating interest. She daintily
drew forth a single strange blossom, and held it, poised
for contrast, against the dark leaves of the fern. Thus
detached, it bore an unfortunate resemblance to a ghostly
spider.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, not stuck off on a cork, like that!&quot; cried the tortured
donor. &quot;All in a lump, don&#39;t you know,&mdash;beaten up like
the whites of eggs, with gold-dust sprinkled over, and parsley
around the edges!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
&quot;All in a lump&mdash;beaten up like eggs&mdash;parsley around the
edges,&quot; began Gwendolen, gravely, when suddenly she tripped
and fell against her own laughter. Her pretty shoulders
quaked. She bent far over for control, and tried to hide the
treacherous mirth.</p>

<p class="indent">But Dodge had seen enough for him. &quot;By Jiminy!
you&#39;ve been jollying me all the time! And I swallowed it
like a bloomin&#39; oyster!&quot; He came around to the front, drew
up a stool, flung himself upon it, and looked up with grins
that bespoke a renewed zest for life. &quot;Now honest, Miss
Todd, you owe me something for this. Didn&#39;t you know
who sent them? Didn&#39;t you really find that card in the
box?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I didn&#39;t&mdash;honest&mdash;but&mdash;m-mother did!&quot; confessed
Gwendolen, now half-stifled with laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you didn&#39;t resent it? And you thought them pretty
from the very first moment?&quot; cried the youth, on a high note
of satisfaction. He reached up now boldly, took the single
flower from her hand, pinched off the end of a long fern-leaf
to back it, and deliberately arranged himself a button-hole.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen wiped the tears of merriment from her bright
eyes. &quot;Pretty?&quot; she echoed. &quot;It is too tame a word. I
thought them a dream,&mdash;an inspiration,&mdash;a visual ecstasy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I said they were like you,&quot; returned the impudent
Dodge, as well as he could for the distorted countenance bent
above the process of pinning in his flower. &quot;There,&quot; he said,
anent this finished operation, &quot;it&#39;s in. I think it becomes
me. I didn&#39;t run my finger to the bone but once. Now tell
me what ma-<i>ma</i> thought of the flowers and the card?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of her usual self-possession, the girl was stricken
dumb. To add to her confusion, a deep embarrassing blush
rose relentlessly to her throat and face, and would not be
banished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won&#39;t repeat it!&quot; cried the terrible youth. &quot;You
don&#39;t dare to,&mdash;but I will. Mama said,&mdash;lifting her lorgnettes
(here he deliberately mimicked the air of a middle-aged
grande dame),&mdash;&#39;T. Caraway Dodge! Who is T.
Caraway Dodge? Oh, I see,&mdash;a snip of an attaché!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A look into the stupefied face above him showed that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
bold guess had been true. Intoxicated by success, he ventured
another toss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you say the word, I come pretty near repeating your
answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Behind the astonishment, then the consternation of the
girl&#39;s face, a harder something flashed. She was not accustomed
to have the lead so rudely taken. This young person
must be disposed of on the instant. His impudence would
have given points to Jonah&#39;s gourd. She now rose to her feet,
held her chin unnecessarily high, and, with the air of a young
Lady Macbeth, drawled out,&mdash;&quot;I will spare you the trouble,
Mr. T. Caraway Dodge. Much as I dislike to be rude, the
words I said were these&mdash;&quot; She paused. Dodge rose too.
The brown eyes and the hazel were nearly on a level. He was
laughing. &quot;Well?&quot; he reminded at length.</p>

<p class="indent">His unconsciousness of offence gave the last flare to her
indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said to those present, &#39;The sending of so costly a bouquet
by Mr. Dodge is a little&mdash;er&mdash;pushing, and the sender
must be told so; but since, by accident,&mdash;the flowers just
happen to suit my gown&mdash;&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; laughed the rash Dodge, &quot;you never talked
that way in your life, unless you deliberately made it up.
That&#39;s your stunt now, of course. Any one could see it.
What is more likely, you said&mdash;what I planned for you to
say was,&mdash;&#39;Oh, here are the flowers I have been waiting for!
I think I&#39;ll have to marry the person who sent me these!&mdash;There&#39;s
the music of the first waltz! It&#39;s a peach! Come,&mdash;you
haven&#39;t promised it, have you? Everybody is waiting
for the hostess to begin. Let us start the ball rolling!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In sheer incapacity to resist, a weakness wrought of a benumbing
conflict of anger, mirth, and amazement, Gwendolen
leaned to him,&mdash;and her débutante ball opened with her, joyous,
whirling in the arms of Mr. T. Caraway Dodge.</p>

<p class="indent">After this initial favor, he was rigidly, even scornfully,
ignored; but little cared Dodge for that. He had had his
day. The impetus given could carry him smiling on through
hours of cold neglect. He was determined to be the gayest
of that circling round of joy, and succeeded. Stout matrons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
lean old maids, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Peruvian,
Pole,&mdash;just so it wore skirts and could move its feet, all were
food for his new mill of ecstasy.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen danced oftenest with Pierre. He was literally
a perfect dancer, and to-night he said that the champagne
all went to his heels. Yuki, in her decorous Japanese draperies,
wound about by stiff brocades, did not attempt foreign
dancing.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè and the older members of the suite left early.
Hirai, the secretary, remained, evidently charmed by the long
eyes of his young countrywoman. During the time she was
not talking to him or Pierre, Yuki remained near Mrs. Todd,
delighting the soberer friends who came to speak with them
by her beauty and intelligence. In the pleasure of seeing this
enjoyment of her Oriental protégé, Mrs. Todd forgot to scold
about the affair of the Russian minister, and made only
one remark about Yuki&#39;s undignified and un-American &quot;kow-tow&quot;
to the prince.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was just pushed down, Mrs. Todd,&quot; protested Yuki,
earnestly. &quot;Some hand from my own land pressed me before
I knew. So was I taught to greet our feudal daimyo when I
was the very little girl; so all in Nippon, of old customs,
greet him now. I will try never again to do such a thing in
America.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well, that&#39;s all right!&quot; said the matron, patting
her slim shoulder. &quot;You are a good little girl, if you did
kow-tow. There&#39;s Gwendolen with Pierre again! Doesn&#39;t
she look well to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; echoed Yuki, as her eyes followed the flying
shapes. &quot;&#39;Well&#39; is so faint a little word. To me Gwendolen
looks beautiful,&mdash;beautiful&mdash;like the Sun Goddess in our
land. She is like a bush of yama-buki in the wind! I never
saw nobody at all so beautiful as our Gwendolen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And to think she must give up this brilliant social success,
and go to a heathen country for four years!&quot; mused Mrs.
Todd, gloomily. She had, of course, been told the great
news.</p>

<p class="indent">If Yuki heard the muttered words, she did not show resentment.
The smile of intense affection had not left her face as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
she said aloud: &quot;Anywhere that Gwendolen goes, I think she
will find happiness. She has in her eyes the light of a happy
karma. Evil and sorrow cannot stay with her long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, and what of you, my little Japanese daughter?&quot;
asked Mrs. Todd, touched by the unselfish words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, me!&quot; said Yuki, becoming instantly grave. &quot;I do
not think about my karma,&mdash;each person cannot see his own,
or know of it; it clings about him too close. But if I should
think&mdash;No, I cannot! I am afraid! Ah, here comes back
the sunshine. It is Gwendolen, fanning! Ah, so hot a little
sunshine is Gwendolen! Sit here, and let me make the fan
go fast for you, Gwendolen,&mdash;your wrists&mdash;your throat&mdash;that
will make coolness quicker than just your face!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both girls laughed now, and talked together; Pierre joined
them; Dodge ventured near; the senator came up. It was
a sparkling group, with the centre always Gwendolen; yet
even to Mrs. Todd&#39;s unimaginative eyes, the loneliness of the
little gray figure, the strange blue-black hair, and pointed,
faintly tinted face, struck a note of mystery,&mdash;of something
very near to sadness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Cyrus Carton Todd</span>, born in the farming district of
Pennsylvania, of English and Scotch ancestry, had, as a mere
boy, gone to seek his fortune in the West. This was not, of
course, an original thing to do. Young men and old, families
and whole communities were, at this time, streaming, like banners,
out toward the alluring, unknown lands. Cyrus chose
a broad, lonely stretch of moor in the very heart of a state
sparsely settled, but not too far from the fertile Mississippi
basin. Agriculture, rather than stock-raising, had from the
first been his design. The small, hoarded patrimony went
into fences, a horse, a plough, and a great lethargic sack of
seed. Quick to recognize the advantages of new methods and
new machinery, he became, before the age of thirty, one of the
successful &quot;large farmers&quot; of his adopted state.</p>

<p class="indent">He loved, with a passionate, personal love, his broad black
fields. He knew, before they ventured one slim, verdant herald
to the air, the stirring of immortal essence in his buried grain.
He thrilled, sometimes with the stinging of quick tears, when
first the green prophecy ran, like an answering cry, from furrow
to swart furrow. He moved, at harvest-time, among the
hung, encrusted stalks with the deep joy of a creator who sees
his work well done. Every process was vital,&mdash;the sowing,
reaping, storing, and, last of all, the hissing of the great gold
torrents as they plunged headlong into caverns of waiting cars.
His acreage was wide, but not too wide for his heart. His
great working force of men was organized and controlled with
the tact and ease of a leader. Mrs. Todd, the daughter of an
Illinois farmer, (of late she was successfully forgetting the
fact), came into his life when, as a girl of eighteen, she had
&quot;visited&quot; a neighbor&#39;s home. Todd was then thirty-one.
The difference in age seemed great to him, but apparently not
to Susan. She arrived in mid-autumn, at the height of a golden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
yield. Cyrus loved the whole world then, and it was not difficult
for the rosy girl to secure for herself a special niche.</p>

<p class="indent">They were married in the following spring, when the planting
was over, and Cyrus&#39;s fields ran with an emerald fire. The
farmer turned, perforce, to contemplation of his house. Bare
walls and rough pine floors were well enough for him, but
better should be found for Susan. She assisted him in selecting
the new furnishings, and then, with the self-possession
known only to a woman and a hen, entered upon her kingdom.</p>

<p class="indent">Her presence, for a long while after, affected Todd as something
in the nature of a miracle. Women had borne little part
in his life. The dainty touches of ornament which his wife&#39;s
quick fingers gave the little home, the good, unheard-of things
she cooked for him, the demonstrative affection she was ever
ready to bestow (for indeed she loved him dearly), kept him
in a sort of daze of unbelieving bliss. He felt that he and life
were even. Now he began to learn what money, hitherto a
neglected factor in his success, had the power to grant.</p>

<p class="indent">The plain cottage grew into an attractive, vine-held home.
Going to his fields each morning, after a perfect breakfast,
he argued aloud to himself, and frequently pinched his own
arm to prove the brightness true. Everything prospered.
The men liked him, the dogs fawned upon him, the horses
whinnied at his voice. And then, just as he told himself
he couldn&#39;t possibly make room for another joy,&mdash;came
Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">Cyrus, when his eyes had cleared of the golden blur, drew
a chair to the bed, put his two elbows on the rim, set his face
upon his hands, and deliberately made acquaintance with his
daughter. The miracle of his wife&#39;s love, the immortality of
springing seed, the awe left over from his boyish dreams
of heaven, all hid themselves in that small, pink frame, and
looked out upon him through its feeble gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">He wished to name her &quot;Susan,&quot; after his wife, and, as it
happened, after his mother also. Mrs. Todd would not consider
it. She desired her child to have a &quot;pretty&quot; name,
something high-sounding, even sentimental, that would look
well in a novel. Her thought whirred like a distracted
magnet between three euphonious points,&mdash;&quot;Gwendolen,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
&quot;Guinevere,&quot; and &quot;Theodora.&quot; At Guinevere Cyrus at
once took an obstinate stand. It suggested to him guinea-hens.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then &#39;Theodora,&#39; Cy. What is the matter with &#39;Theodora&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It sounds like the tin tail to a fancy windmill. I can
just see it spin!&quot; declared the anxious father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the sentiment! It means &#39;gift of God,&#39;&quot; pleaded
Mrs. Todd, in the voice she usually kept for church.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shucks! She don&#39;t need a label, &#39;made in heaven,&#39;&quot;
said Cy. &quot;Nobody &#39;d take her as coming up from the other
place. Why, if she dropped there now, she&#39;d put out flames
like a hand extinguisher,&mdash;the blessed cheraphim!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, &#39;Gwendolen,&#39; then. Surely you can&#39;t find any such
ridiculous objections to &#39;Gwendolen.&#39;&quot; The young wife now
was plainly on the verge of tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s fancy and high-falutin&#39; for my taste,&quot; said honest
Cyrus, &quot;but it&#39;s not so bad as those others. If you want it,
have it! I can&#39;t stand out against you, darling. I can call
her &#39;daughter&#39; when I&#39;m tired.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Gwendolen she was christened, and in time Cyrus became
not only reconciled, but actually proud of the pretty
name, saying that it sounded yellow, like her hair.</p>

<p class="indent">In earlier years of struggle,&mdash;pleasant stress it had always
been&mdash;Cyrus Todd, in the wide, lonely life of the prairie, had
become a reader of books. His pious English mother had not
died before transmitting to her boy her veneration for the
great souls of the past. Among his very few possessions,
brought originally from Pennsylvania, were three books;&mdash;Shakespeare,
the Bible, and, strangely enough, a copy of Marco
Polo. During the days of poverty these three formed his
sole, incessant reading. Afterward he bought more books,
generally bound garbage-heaps of literature, perpetrated in
rich boards, and disseminated by strenuous agents who urged
to purchase with a glibness unknown to any since Beelzebub.
A few good books came to him, generally by a fortuitous mischance.
Imitating his neighbors, he sent in subscriptions to
the &quot;Western Farmer&#39;s Evangel&quot; and &quot;The Horn of Plenty.&quot;
He read everything, bad or good, keeping new words and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
phrases strictly out of his daily vocabulary. His time had
not yet come for mental segregation.</p>

<p class="indent">Chiefly because of this modest simplicity of his speech, no
one suspected him of the growing passion. Never was a
figure less scholarly to view. His keen eyes of bluish green,
with their trick of closing slightly from underneath when
interested, seemed to look out toward horizons of actual experience,
rather than along those shadowy vistas down which
the pilgrim band of thinkers moves. His limbs, loosely hung,
were made for striding over furrows. His mouth, thin-lipped
and straight, sensitive at the corners to any hint of humor or
of pathos, showed early lines of shrewdness and self-restraint.
Never a great talker, he was, as a listener, an inspiration.
His silences in conversation were not of the brooding, introspective
kind in which one seems to be planning his own
next remark, but of deep and intelligent interest in what his
companion was saying. He was alert, practical, interested in
many things, sympathetic with many views.</p>

<p class="indent">Within the badly printed pages of the &quot;Farmer&#39;s Evangel&quot;
he found his first clue to the outer world. This was an illustrated
article on rice culture,&mdash;in Japan. Before he had
turned the first column he felt the threads of destiny pull.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Them little chaps is all right, I guess,&quot; he remarked
aloud, at the top of the second column.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No red rust on Johnny Jap!&quot; he murmured admiringly, at
the third.</p>

<p class="indent">With the fourth and last strip of reading, mated to a
pictured group of Chinese coolies flailing rye, he let the paper
fall and his soul go straying.</p>

<p class="indent">The descriptions of Japanese method and result were bald
enough and full of error. Beneath them, as through a tangled
undergrowth, he saw reality. Joining this new knowledge to
remembered tales of Marco Polo, an electric spark flashed out.
Old Marco was not a mere romancer, then, fellow of Sinbad
and Munchausen, but a speaker of truths! There existed still,
somewhere on earth, those marvellous countries with old, old
cultures stored for us with prophecy, and a crowded generation
through which must still run the living sap. If one went
west, always west, to the edge of a great water, beyond that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
water he would reach Japan,&mdash;as once Columbus cut the
sands of Hispaniola. At that first moment came into Todd&#39;s
mind, half dreamily, though not the less imperishable because
of shimmering mist, a determination to travel, some day, to that
Far East, and see for himself what Marco Polo must have seen.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd, after his marriage, continued to grow rich. The
pretty cottage was abandoned for a great house near &quot;town.&quot;
It had hallways, a porte cochère, and a huge billiard-room
which none but the cat ever visited. The town itself, in its
spidery focus of busy railways, had not existed when Cyrus
first came. He had often strolled, whistling, through future
business blocks, and over smoking breweries.</p>

<p class="indent">The Todds &quot;grew up,&quot; as they termed it, with the place,
Cyrus specially clinging with tenacious loyalty to the state
which had made the background of so much happiness. As
Gwendolen passed from a golden childhood into a maidenhood
no less bright, Mrs. Todd was heard to murmur reluctantly
mild objurgations against the &quot;rawness&quot; of the West,
its unconventionality, and lack of true culture.</p>

<p class="indent">At fourteen, Gwendolen was not only precocious in school-work
and music, but her beauty promised to be of so unusual
and unmistakable a type that Mrs. Todd took fond alarm, and
declared that the child must go at once to New York, where
she could be decently &quot;finished.&quot; Gwendolen protested and
wept. She had her father&#39;s happy heart, and thought that
nothing could be quite so near perfection as their life at
home. Mrs. Todd, secure in her conviction, proved inexorable.
Cyrus was appealed to, and something in the dejected
look of his face gave his wife a thrill of triumph. She soon
prevailed, and Todd, in person, prepared to lead his one lamb
to the sacrificial altar of &quot;society.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He left her on the brown-stone doorstep in New York, his
heart far heavier than her own. The gay metropolis had no
attractions then. He took the next train home, tasting his
first real sorrow since his mother&#39;s death. He felt cold and
chill at the thought of the big home emptied now of his idol.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd met him, not with the expected torrent of tears,
but with a face red and twitching in excitement. The leading
political party of his state had &quot;split,&quot; and he, the farmer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Cyrus Todd, was to be run for United States senator. This
strange news proved indeed an antidote for melancholy. In
less than an hour he had been into town, and learned for himself
how the &quot;land lay.&quot; Two candidates, well matched, with
equal backing, had just been declared by a great uprising of
conservative voters utterly unsatisfactory. Todd was asked to
be the dark horse. He would have turned from the proposition
flattered and abashed, with the one remark that he
&quot;wasn&#39;t the cut of cloth for a politician,&quot; but ambition had
begun to work like a fever in the veins of Mrs. Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">Already the magnate of her small community, she wished to
test her powers in the capital itself. She knew that Gwendolen
was to be a beauty, and recognized the potency of an
attractive débutante, allied to a rich father and an aspiring
mama. The longest letter ever penned by her fat hand
now sped to Gwendolen. Her arguments were good, though
turgidly expressed. Gwendolen took fire. In a tumult of
violet-tinted letters, chokingly perfumed, she assured her
father that the school in which she now languished was a
cheerless jail. She said that the plain fare, particularly the
raw beef, choked her, and that the rooms were kept so hot
that soon she must go into consumption. Above all, she
was dying by inches so far away from her &quot;dear, precious,
darling, angelic dad!&quot; It was this last representation that
won. Todd gave in his name, made a few public speeches
that surprised him more than his friends by their humor,
sparkle, and good sense, and with little further effort received
the nomination.</p>

<p class="indent">For more than four years, now, the Todds had lived in
Washington. Mrs. Todd&#39;s initial step had been to buy a good,
substantial home in a fashionable neighborhood. She soon
realized that she was not to dominate society; but, after a
few months of sulking, she adjusted herself comfortably to the
new conditions, and enjoyed her life thoroughly. Gwendolen
was put to the best private school in the city. She could be
at home now, in the evenings, to play her father &quot;those tinkly,
skee-daddly pieces&quot; which he liked. No homely melodies for
Senator Todd! His childhood was passed without them, and
they bore no tender recollections. Chopin, and an occasional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
rag-time bit, stirred his veins. Gwendolen&#39;s music-master had
kept to himself hopes that, in the girl, he might have a brilliant
result;&mdash;her parents had neither the knowledge nor
the insight to perceive it for themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen was fashioned for brilliant playing. Elemental
or sombre music baffled her. She played with laughter,
sometimes with fire,&mdash;by preference in the full light of the
sun. Through Tschaikowsky&#39;s broken rainbows she passed
like a spirit. Beethoven, in his glad moods, seemed a mirror
in which she saw herself. Chopin as a sentimentalist she despised,
even while she thrilled to his unearthly delicacy of
phrasing. She grew steadily, yet remained unconscious of the
increasing power. She only knew that, in certain moods,
it was almost a necessity to play, and that people liked to
hear her.</p>

<p class="indent">As time went on, Mr. Todd&#39;s political estimate of himself
began to be echoed jeeringly by his opponents, and sometimes
reluctantly by his friends. He had realized early
enough that official exigency in Washington was his cross, his
penalty, the price he was doomed to pay. The intricacies of
method surprised and repelled him; the insincerity met on all
sides he designated despairingly as the &quot;San José scale&quot; of
humanity. Graft, political jobbery, the oppressions of power,
sickened him. &quot;I don&#39;t like it, Susan. I wasn&#39;t made for
this sort of a harness,&quot; he complained one day to his wife.
&quot;A fellow can&#39;t walk straight or talk straight in this life; and
some of these old rum-soaked bosses have actually lost the
power of saying what they mean. These female lobbyists,
too, they make a man ashamed to look a good wife in the
face. I wish we could quit. I like politeness and manners,&mdash;I&#39;ve
turned off the road for a sick lizard&mdash;but I&#39;ll be
ding-danged if I can grin and scrape in the evening to a
man who, in that same morning&#39;s newspaper, has called me
a liar and a thief!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd joined him in a sigh. &quot;I know it&#39;s hard, dear.
I realize just what you mean. There is some of it in my own
career, though of course I don&#39;t expect anybody to think of
<i>me</i>! The airs put on by these mushroom aristocrats who
have pulled themselves up by their own boot-straps are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
enough to make one ill. But we must not think of ourselves.
It&#39;s Gwennie! Washington is better for her future prospects
than our dear Western home. We must try to endure Washington
a little longer for her sake.&quot; Mrs. Todd made strong
effort to look and feel like an impersonal martyr. She did not
succeed very well. Hypocrisy had a tendency to shrivel under
the keen eyes that now twinkled appreciatively upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just so,&quot; drawled Cyrus. &quot;For daughter&#39;s sake only we
continue to sip the nauseating draught. I agree, then. I
guess our inwards will not be seriously impaired.&quot; It was
perhaps as near insincerity as Todd ever approached, this
clinging, despite better knowledge, to uncultured forms of
speech. Even in the senate he showed determination to
remain a raw Westerner, rather than identify himself with
that sandpapered and lacquered body of gentlemen.</p>

<p class="indent">His compensations for all discomfort were found in huddled,
intoxicating rows on the shelves of the new Congressional
Library. Here his interest in the Far East, first awakened
by the garrulous Venetian, shone back from a thousand reflecting
facets of new truths. He strengthened theory with
fact. He knew how many car-loads of Northwestern grain,
how many bales of Southern cotton were shipped annually to
expanding Asiatic markets from our Pacific ports. He traced
the colonial policies of Europe back to the days when adventurous
Spaniards had won the timid Philippines, but, seeking
further glory, had knocked in vain at the gates of Japan.
China, too, the richest prize in the East, he knew to be stirring
in her long sleep. He believed that her destiny, central
in the future currents of trade, must become the key to the
world&#39;s development. With keen eyes he watched the joints
of the Siberian railway, like a giant centipede, reduplicating,
joint by joint, always insidiously, toward the storm centre of
the Yellow Sea.</p>

<p class="indent">The old Romans argued the future from the flight of a bird.
It happened now to Todd that the love of one schoolgirl
for another brought before him a clearer knowledge of baffling
Eastern questions than had all his years of rapt
apprenticeship.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Onda of Tokio (Onda Yuki-ko, the full name had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
registered) arrived, as boarding inmate of the fashionable
Washington Academy, only a few weeks after Gwendolen.
She was dainty, shrinking, friendless, and pathetically homesick.
Gwendolen became her champion. With a great ruffling
of wings she kept at bay the impertinent and the curious.
Yuki, thankful from the first for the protection, responded
more slowly to the love. The Japanese girl was by nature
silent, meditative, reserved. Above all she was,&mdash;to use her
schoolmates&#39; expression&mdash;&quot;different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was fully three months after the initial friendship that
the American succeeded in enticing her home. After this, the
course of true love ran smooth. Each Friday night not passed
with her Japanese friends, the Kanrios, was spent with Gwendolen.
Yuki learned to giggle, and to have secrets, and dote
on fudge like any American schoolgirl. She learned to dress,
too, in the American way, and to heap her soft, dry, blue-black
hair into a dusky &quot;pompadour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From the first she was a delight to Todd. He thought of
her as a strange bird of Paradise rather than a dove, sent out
from the ark of her country, that floated for him, somewhere,
on waters of mystery. He encouraged hesitating confidences
regarding her home life. Stoically he kept from laughter
when her quaint grammatical errors convulsed Gwendolen
and Mrs. Todd. Through Yuki he began to suspect the passionate,
vital note of loyalty which is the keynote to Japanese
character.</p>

<p class="indent">Memories of her happy childhood seemed never far away.
Before the little feet touched earth, while still warm on her
nurse&#39;s back, she had been taught to drink in visual beauty.
Heroism was instilled in her through toys and story-books,
and through temple feasts to gods who once were men. Old
age was something to be revered, almost envied,&mdash;white hairs
a benediction. The American levity and callousness shown by
the young to the old appeared, from the first, in Yuki&#39;s mind,
and remained ever after, the chief blot upon a country otherwise
beloved. Todd saw that the girl in her own land must
have moved as though consciously surrounded by spirit. She
said to him that, in Nippon, the air was awake and vital;
that there, ever went on about men the tangling and untangling

of great forces, to which, the living are as but
shadows on a moving stream.</p>

<p class="indent">Through Yuki, too, he became a friend, even an intimate,
of Baron Kanrio, the Japanese minister. To be intimate
with any Japanese is a rare privilege, and Todd knew it.
Many were the notable evenings spent in Kanrio&#39;s small
private den, where the two men bent together over records
and reports, and over maps whereon they traced with prophetic
fingers the contour curves of overflowing races. The
insight of the other fairly staggered Todd. Slowly the
American breathed in, rather than acquired by grosser senses,
something of the patient, confident loyalty to ideals,&mdash;the
Japanese strength that comes with absolute spiritual unity,
the power of race in the living, and, more potent still, in
the dead.</p>

<p class="indent">Late in the afternoon of a bright March day, the fourth and
last of Gwendolen&#39;s school years in Washington, Mrs. Todd
sat alone at a front window of her handsome bedchamber,
looking out dreamily into thickening dusk. The day was
Friday. Yuki and Gwendolen giggled over a chafing-dish of
fudge in a room across the hall. Merry laughter, more often
from Gwendolen, rang through the house, trailing pleasant
echoes.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd seldom sat alone, and seldom indulged in revery.
Now, however, she consciously caressed the reflection
that, apart from an obstinate increase of flesh, she had not a
trouble in the world. She was proud of her husband, proud
of her daughter, pleased with herself. Her mind held no regrets,
her closet no skeletons. A familiar step on the sidewalk
caused her to look down. The senator was returning
early from the library. She smiled with wifely comprehension
at the pose of the down-bent head, at the hands thrust,
Western fashion, to the full depths of new, English trousers.
&quot;Cy has something on his mind,&quot; she murmured. &quot;He&#39;s
coming to hunt me up and get it off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She heard him banging one downstairs door after the other,
then running, with the lightness of a boy, up the stairway.
His tone expressed relief at seeing her dark shadow-bulk
against the window-frame. &quot;Susan! That you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
&quot;Yes. You are early, dear. Shall I ring for lights?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;no,&quot; cried the other hastily. &quot;I&#39;m a little tired&mdash;that&#39;s
all&mdash;and a little&mdash;excited. This warm dusk just
suits me. It&#39;s fine to talk in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After saying this, he remained so long wordless that Mrs.
Todd&#39;s curiosity urged the question. &quot;Was it anything definite
that you had to say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Definite! It&#39;s worse than definite. It&#39;s colossal!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say it quick, then. I&#39;ll be on pins and needles till you
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, to put it briefly&mdash;our U. S. minister at Tokio,
<i>Jap</i>-an,&mdash;Evans, you know,&mdash;Brunt Evans of Illinois,&mdash;well,
Evans is on the point of resigning because of ill health,&mdash;and
if I want the appointment&mdash;if I really try,&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;don&#39;t stop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother, I <i>want</i> it!&quot; cried the man, in a tone she had not
heard him use for years. &quot;You know how I&#39;ve always felt
about that country! I want the appointment as I have never
wanted anything since I got you!&quot; His thin hands twitched,
his eyes pleaded. He might have been a schoolboy begging
for the treasure of a gun, a horse, a holiday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To give up&mdash;Washington, and live in that strange land!&quot;
whispered Mrs. Todd, as though fear touched her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It needn&#39;t be but for a matter of four years, mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there not talk of war with Russia?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and that&#39;s my chief reason for wanting to go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you realize that Gwendolen, our only child, is to graduate
this June, and formally come out next season?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and that&#39;s my chief reason for wanting to stay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd pressed her lips together. A suspicious gleam
came to her pale eyes. &quot;This is the work of Yuki Onda!
You both are infatuated about that girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Susan, how utterly unjust! Yuki has no more
political influence than our cook. She doesn&#39;t dream of this
possibility, she or Gwendolen either. You are the only one
besides myself to hear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The girls will be wild when they are told. Gwendolen
will be mad to go! Society, flattery, success, a great catch,&mdash;all
I have worked for&mdash;will be nothing!&quot; Todd wisely kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
silence. Mrs. Todd rose unsteadily to her feet. &quot;There is
no doubt that you all will be frantic to go&mdash;all three of you&mdash;without
a thought for me.&quot; Seizing each side of the
parted curtain, she stood, as at a tent door, staring out into a
blackening sky.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll be a big gun out there, Mrs. Cyrus Carton Todd,&quot;
wheedled a low voice. &quot;Bigger, in some ways, than you&#39;ll
ever get to be over here. Those foreign embassies are bargain-counters
of dukes and princes. The American globe-trotters
will be so many kneeling pilgrims at your shrine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd stared on. Slowly upon the night, as upon a
transparency, luminous letters began to form. &quot;Mrs. Todd,
the stately and distinguished consort of Minister Cyrus Carton
Todd, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
from the United States to Japan. Miss Gwendolen de Lancy
Todd, a famous Washington beauty, now in her first season.&quot;
Beneath the words appeared, as in a phosphorescent mist, a
long, long dining-table, rich with the beauty of lace, cut glass,
silver, and flowers; while ringed about it leaned and laughed
her guests,&mdash;famous men and women of two worlds, members
of old nobilities, native princes, and, perhaps, even visitors of
blood royal, for who, in these days, would slight an invitation
from the representative of earth&#39;s greatest republic?</p>

<p class="indent">Senator Todd pensively regarded the scallops of his wife&#39;s
uplifted profile. &quot;You&#39;d make a stunning figure in a court
dress, mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She wheeled fiercely upon him. &quot;You are sure Gwendolen
suspects nothing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure. And if you take it like this, dear, she need never
know that the chance was offered.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His companion gave a small, irrepressible sob. In an
instant the long arms were about her. &quot;Now, Susie, don&#39;t
you be losing any sleep over this. I won&#39;t take a step unless
you give the word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dreading his tenderness more than any argument, she pushed
him away half laughing, half crying, &quot;No&mdash;no&mdash;go on with
you! I won&#39;t be honey-fuggled! I know your ways. It
has come upon me rather sudden, and I haven&#39;t caught my
breath! But you might as well tell Gwennie and be done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
with it! I couldn&#39;t keep such a secret from her, even if you
could. It&#39;s too b-big! And she&#39;ll be just wy-wy-wild to
go!&quot; The last sentence was a wail.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forget it, mother! Drat the whole thing! Let it vanish!&quot;
urged Cyrus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; she cried instantly, and shook her head with vehemence.
&quot;I can&#39;t accept the sacrifice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you agree, then, for me to&mdash;to&mdash;try?&quot; asked Todd,
fighting down a desperate joy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o&quot; she hesitated, &quot;not exactly agree, either; only
I&#39;m not willing to take upon myself to stop the whole thing
here at the beginning. I&#39;m not the Lord! Maybe this is
planned out by higher powers; and then, besides,&quot; she
added with a gleam of hope, &quot;maybe you won&#39;t get it, after
all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd&#39;s face bore a curious expression. His under lids
closed slightly. &quot;No,&quot; he repeated slowly, &quot;maybe I won&#39;t
get it, after all. But it&#39;s only fair to tell you that, if I am
turned loose to try, I&#39;m going to try like&mdash;hell!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Todd household slept until late the morning after the
party. Next to the efficient hirelings,&mdash;those ball-bearing
sockets of domestic ease,&mdash;the senator himself was first to
awake.</p>

<p class="indent">He came slowly into the day, as though passing from a fair
garden into one more fair. That sense of some great good,
new-garnered, and in the warm sweet haze of sleep not quite
recalled, caressed his smiling lips. In spite of dalliance, the
shining consciousness drew near. His appointment had been
given! Ah, that was the new glory! He was in effect, at
that instant, &quot;Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary&quot;
to a Wonderland! It was not the honor that thrilled
him, but the opportunity. He would have a niche near the
breathing heart of that strange country. Proving himself
worthy, he might go deeper, drinking at that spiritual fountain
of eternal youth.</p>

<p class="indent">Lying now on his rich, canopied bed, with all the luxury of
modern Occidental life heaped close, Todd told himself that,
because of the success, he was all the more a soul, an individual,
with better things to seek. He scorned to be a pampered
animal, possessed by its possessions. He envied anew
the clean, sweet poverty of the samurai&#39;s code.</p>

<p class="indent">He was now at that elevation in life where past events
take proper place, as in a landscape, and vistas begin. Yesterday
was his fiftieth year. By another coincidence&mdash;those
clashings of star-beams in his career&mdash;his birthday fell on
that of the Japanese Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking back now, he could see where streams of tendency,
taking rise in boyhood, had worked steadily, though through
seeming deviations, towards this one great tide of purpose.
His lonely interest in rice-culture had been a hidden spring;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
his coming to Washington, where Japan&#39;s development was a
living topic instead of a solitary reader&#39;s dream, a winding
stream of fate. Yuki herself was a deep well of inspiration.
Now at last had come his opportunity to serve, in one life-giving
effort, his own beloved country,&mdash;and Japan. The
future widened for him into a deep harbor where great fleets
of achievement might find safe anchorage.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki entered for the ten o&#39;clock breakfast in full street
costume. At Mrs. Todd&#39;s lifted eyebrows of inquiry, Gwendolen,
who was just behind her friend, explained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has an appointment at eleven with her Hindoo idol.
Baron Kanrio said last night that dad was to go too. Yuki
thought she might be allowed to accompany him, if she were
very good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course!&quot; said the senator, heartily. &quot;Glad to have
her. Prince Haganè gave me the date, eleven, <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, but he
didn&#39;t mention Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, how could you think it?&quot; drawled saucy Gwendolen.
&quot;She&#39;s only a girl. He wouldn&#39;t notice a girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It rather looks as if he <i>had</i> noticed her,&quot; retorted Mr.
Todd. &quot;A definite appointment! They say his daily average
of callers is about two hundred.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is only for my father&#39;s sake. He will give me a message,&quot;
explained Yuki, hastily. &quot;Gwendolen is right. So
great a man do not think much of girls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph,&quot; said Gwendolen, &quot;that doesn&#39;t go! He stared
at you as if you were a candied cherry-petal, and he wanted
to swallow you at a gulp. Pierre Le Beau saw it, too.
Heavens, how he scowled! A regular Medusa! I expect
all the chrysanthemums are turned to yellow onyx by his
glare.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki gave a start, and then flushed with painful intensity.
&quot;Please! Please!&quot; she was beginning, when Mrs. Todd unconsciously
interrupted with an exclamation of delight.</p>

<p class="indent">After her methodical pouring of the coffee, the good lady
had plunged into the morning papers. &quot;Ah, Gwendolen,
these notices are splendid!&mdash;better than I could have hoped.
Society reporters are usually so touchy and carping!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was one youthful Mr. Dooley that I made sure of,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
said Gwendolen, calmly, as she cracked an egg. &quot;I had the
orchestra strike up &#39;Call me thine own!&#39; while I took him to
a corner and plied him with Louis Roederer, Carte Blanche!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Little Yuki and the senator drove off together. Each had
things to think of, though not much to say. The carriage
bowled smoothly along asphalt thoroughfares. At close intervals
small parks were passed, some round, some angular,
but all like emeralds in a web of silver-tinted streets. Now
and then the great meerschaum-colored dome of the Capitol
came into sudden view, with its suggestion of purpose and of
majesty.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl&#39;s neat fawn-tinted dress was now supplemented by
furs, and a wide hat of brown velvet, with a silver chain
about the crown, and nodding feathers. Her hair, puffed
round her face in recent fashion, completed the Americanizing
of her attire. From the dainty gloves, thrust deep into
her muff, to the soft brown boots, she was modern, chic,
Occidental.</p>

<p class="indent">At the Japanese Legation, both Baron Kanrio and the
prince&#39;s secretary, Hirai, were awaiting them. The eyes of
the latter shone with eagerness at sight of his young compatriot.
Kanrio sent them, chattering already of Japan, into
the drawing-room to await Yuki&#39;s summons. With a slight
gesture he beckoned to Todd, and they went together along
the hall to the well-known den.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè sat in it, alone. The disposition of the few stiff
chairs bespoke recent visitors. The library table, covered
with green leather, had maps upon it, letters and papers, besides
a Japanese smoking outfit and a tray with tea and some
small cups.</p>

<p class="indent">As they entered, the great man slowly rose. He wore again
his plain dark native robes. In the relentless daylight he
appeared older, more sallow, and at the same time more impressive.
His hand-grasp for the senator was cordiality itself.
His deep eyes lighted pleasantly, as he said, &quot;Welcome,
your Excellency!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd started, and then flushed like a boy, at the title.
Kanrio grinned with delight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;beg pardon; but it&#39;s the first time. Rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
knocked me off my pins. Thanks, your Highness! I feel it
a good omen to have it come from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we be seated?&quot; asked Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gomen&mdash;nasai,&quot; (excuse me) murmured Kanrio, with a
gesture. He removed the soiled cups from the table to the
top of a low bookcase, then rang for fresh cups and a new pot
of tea. He and Haganè took a few sips, Japanese fashion;
Todd declined.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand, your Excellency, that your appointment as
envoy to our small island has come the very recent time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only last night, your Highness.&quot; Todd&#39;s eyes met in unembarrassed
candor those of Haganè. &quot;Of course I&#39;ve worked
for it. My heart was set on it. The Baron here has been an
inspiration!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear sir, don&#39;t trouble to recall my unimportant service,&quot;
deprecated Kanrio.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand,&quot; said Haganè, slowly, &quot;that for some time
you have honored our&mdash;country&mdash;with your studious&mdash;interest.
If it is not impertinence, may I venture to inquire
what&mdash;circumstances, what&mdash;a&mdash;unfamiliar categories&mdash;first
stung your thought to the pursuit of Far Eastern knowledge?&quot;
He spoke very slowly, slurring neither vowel nor
consonant, and choosing, it would seem, from a rich vocabulary.
Nevertheless he pieced the words together with a
slight effort.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd knitted his brows, not in lack of understanding, but
from desire to answer definitely and concisely the comprehensive
question.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè may have mistaken the silence, for he added immediately,
&quot;My English is&mdash;stiff,&mdash;not well&mdash;man&oelig;uvred. My
meanings perhaps become involved. Shall not Baron Kanrio
stand as&mdash;interpreter&mdash;for my heavy thought?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no,&quot; said Todd, eagerly. &quot;Do not think it, your
Highness! I understand perfectly. Your very misuse of
some of our slippery old timeworn words is illuminating.
It was your question that made me pause, not your way of
putting it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; protested Haganè, &quot;I desire you to feel no
obligations to answer. I intended, perhaps, a thinner meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
than your own mind has seized. Was it Japanese Art, as
with Frenchmen? Statistics, Sociology, Political Economy?&quot;
Todd noted the greater ease with which these abstract and
philosophic terms were employed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None of these, your Highness,&mdash;and yet all! My study&mdash;you
will think me presumptuous, I fear,&mdash;might not be
called less than&mdash;the ultimate destiny of your race!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè&#39;s smouldering eyes leaped into sudden fire. He
looked down quickly, as if to deny the flame. Todd felt the
air stir and tingle with a new vibration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your Excellency, we are attempting to employ valuable
hints from various representative governments of your
enlightened West,&quot; said he, conventionally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hints!&quot; echoed Todd; &quot;that is just the wonder of you!
They are hints in reality, thoughts to be absorbed only just
so far as you need them, and the rest chucked. You don&#39;t
stick them on like plaster to cover up a mediæval birthmark.
You have quite as much to give as we, and you know it.
Haven&#39;t I watched and studied, with Kanrio here to coach?
You Japanese alone can combine the best of the two civilizations.
You can best fuse the experience, character, insight,
humanity&mdash;of both long-suffering hemispheres. We Americans
are just ourselves; but you are we, and all the rest of it!
That&#39;s why your old gods set you on the fighting line. You
are a whole laboratory experiment in sociology, all to yourselves!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I perceive that you have been thinking carefully upon
us,&quot; said Haganè, still conventional, contained; but his one
upward look, instantly withdrawn, had the &quot;swish&quot; of a
scythe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t all admiration, you know!&quot; exclaimed Todd, with
an impulsiveness far more flattering than reserve. &quot;You have
made, it seems to me, some thundering bad mistakes,&mdash;like
the dropping of Port Arthur at the first growl of that bear,
Russia. But you&#39;ve got your second wind all right. You
Japanese know, better than any American or Englishman,
that Russian preponderance in China means a walled continent
of tyranny, the gates guarded by Greek fire. If you
conquer, your best interests are at one with the progress of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
enlightened twentieth-century world. Now, your Highness,
deny it if you can!&quot; He leaned back, his thin face aglow.
Haganè apparently had difficulty in keeping eyes upon the
table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&mdash;er&mdash;pass through the waving branches,&quot; said he,
very slowly, &quot;and cleave to the heart of the tree. So only are
the rings of epochs counted. Do others of your countrymen
think thus?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Todd, &quot;to be honest, I judge that most of my
countrymen would prefer sitting on the bough, stealing apples,
rather than counting concentric rings. I guess love of the
East must have been born with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Interesting, interesting!&quot; murmured Haganè. &quot;And yet,
your Excellency, though indigenous, something must have fed
the growth. Every development possess, I think, allotted
kind of nourishment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, events contributed, I presume. Now and then things
turned up just when they were wanted.&quot; Todd was surprised
at his own ease in the great man&#39;s presence. He drew inspiration,
not awe, from the intelligent eyes and slow, suggestive
smile. &quot;Yes, things <i>came</i>! I planted your Forty-Seven
Ronin into my biggest field of wheat! And my old mule,
Kuranosukè, did me better work than any span of horses.
Then, your Highness, the baron here&mdash;oh, you needn&#39;t
shake your finger, Baron!&mdash;pointed me to heavenly manna;
and the child Yuki, my daughter&#39;s friend, led me into paths
that adult eyes could never have seen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè crushed the red ash of his cigarette, and leaned
farther back in his chair. The expression of his face altered
slightly,&mdash;softened, one might say, were it not still so impressive.
If waves of strength and influence had flowed from
him before, they ebbed now, leaving consciousness a little
thin and dry. Yet all three men smiled faintly, as at a
pleasant thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, little Onda Yuki-ko, the child of my old kerai.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a term meaning &#39;feudal retainer,&#39;&quot; put in Kanrio,
amiably, to Mr. Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; went on Haganè, &quot;I was encouraged last night to
see her so strong to look at, and so&mdash;pardon vulgarity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
your Excellency,&mdash;so inoffensive to the eye in personal
appearance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd flung back his head and laughed outright. &quot;Inoffensive&mdash;that&#39;s
a good one! Why, your Highness, Yuki is
quoted as a beauty here in Washington. Artists beg to paint
her, and swell photographers to pose. If she intended casting
in her lot with us, she could have the pick and choice of half
the young bloods here.&quot; He sent a merry glance to Kanrio,
as for corroboration, but was met by a stare so blank, so baffling,
that his smile faded.</p>

<p class="indent">The prince was carefully, very carefully, lighting a fresh
cigarette. &quot;Pardonnez moi!&quot; he mumbled, between coaxing,
initial puffs. &quot;It is I who am the stupidity! &#39;Pick and
choice,&mdash;young bloods&#39;&mdash;I fear I do not quite&mdash;er&mdash;apprehend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Highness,&quot; Kanrio broke in, &quot;Mr. Todd speaks in
the idiomatic phrases of society. He desired to transmit the
impression that Miss Onda is thought to be beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, is that it? And&mdash;young bloods?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young men, I should have said. Pardon my slang. Merely
young men, your Highness,&quot; explained Cyrus, feeling suddenly
quite ill at ease.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; muttered Haganè to himself. &quot;I have a recollection.
Last night&mdash;&quot; he broke off. His voice was
higher and a little careless, as he asked of Todd, directly,
&quot;Is Onda Yuki-ko to sail with your family?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. She had not intended returning till next spring.
She wanted to take an extra course in French or something.
But she wouldn&#39;t stay behind, now that we are going. She
and my daughter are like sisters.&quot; Todd rose, muttering words
to the effect that he had trespassed too long. Haganè rose
also. Todd felt resentful, though he could have assigned no
definite cause. &quot;Good-morning, your Highness, or, as Miss
Yuki has taught me to say, &#39;Sayonara&#39;! I thank you for the
honor of this interview.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The word &quot;Sayonara&quot; brought Haganè sharply to himself.
&quot;The thanks belong not to me, Excellency,&quot; he smiled and
stretched out a powerful hand. &quot;Seldom do I so deeply enjoy
a conversation with one met for the first time. I consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
that Nippon, and our-Sacred Emperor&quot;&mdash;(he paused, and
the two Japanese bowed deeply,) &quot;are to receive the congratulation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Power and purpose thrilled in his hand-clasp. Todd tingled
anew with it. &quot;What a man! What a bottled genius hauled
up from a sea of fate!&quot; he said to Kanrio, as they descended
the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prince Sanètomo is one who does his duty,&quot; admitted
Kanrio, in an impassive tone.</p>

<p class="indent">Hirai accompanied Yuki to the office door. They went
a little slowly, considering the rank of the summoner, and
talked hurriedly in the hall-ways, each reluctant to release
a topic so dear. There had been not only Japan and childhood
to gloat upon, but, already, reference could be made to a past,&mdash;twelve
hours old. &quot;Do you remember,&quot; and &quot;As you were
saying last evening,&quot; are potent introductory clauses. Both
young people had been born in Tokio, and though unnamed
to each other before, soon established unity of class, training,
inherited ideals, and childish experiences. The secretary had
often heard of Sir Onda Tetsujo, Yuki&#39;s father, a knight of
the old school, famed for his stern rectitude and his loyalty
to a vanished past. With some hesitation Hirai ventured to
suggest that he should consider it a privilege to be allowed to
call upon Sir Tetsujo and his lady, in their Tokio home. Yuki
urged this eagerly. She could send by the younger man messages
that seemed too trivial for transmission through Prince
Haganè. &quot;Yes, yes,&mdash;please call upon them&mdash;d&#333;-zo!
They will receive you so happily. Ah, and to think that you
will see them long, long before I can come! You will reach
Nippon before the maples have quite burned themselves
away, or Fuji lowered upon her opal cone the full white robe
of winter. How am I to endure the waiting? I wish I were
to start with the suite of Prince Haganè to-morrow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hirai&#39;s fine face echoed this sentiment vividly, but he refrained
from speech. He was a correct young man, and had
no intention of presuming on the young girl&#39;s veneer of
Americanism. He left her at the door. It had to her fancy,
now, the feeling of a shrine, a Shinto temple, approached
through paths of childish memories. She lifted one gloved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
hand to knock, and her lips twitched at the clamorous instinct
to raise both hands, rub the palms together, and clap thrice
as before a deity. She controlled herself, however, shaking
her head a little wistfully, and murmuring as to a voice, &quot;No,
though my soul still is Nipponese, I have become a Christian.
I am half American, too. I must remember.&quot; She gave now
a sharp, determined rap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O-idè!&quot; boomed a deep voice from within. Yuki&#39;s knees
melted. Whatever the rest of her, they were evidently not
American. She entered with downcast eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè did not seem to recognize her. He looked hard, and
asked, &quot;Is this Onda Yuki-ko?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted the brim of her hat, and let shy eyes rest upon
him. &quot;Your Highness, it is Yuki, a worthless young acquaintance
with whom you spoke last night.&quot; She used the
Japanese language, with the full complement of honorifics.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An odd eventuation,&quot; said the other, dryly. &quot;I thought
to summon the child of my old kerai, the maiden of last evening,&mdash;and,
behold, a small, pert shade from the Avenue de
l&#39;Opéra!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does not augustly displease your Highness?&quot; murmured
the girl, not understanding his full meaning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all. It may even prove valuable for Nippon, and
Tetsujo could wish no more. But be seated, child. I have
scanty moments to dole you, and there are messages.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord,&quot; murmured Yuki, seating herself on the hard chair
indicated, &quot;it is too much for you to burden your exalted
memory for my insignificant satisfaction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè ignored the deprecating whisper. Taking a seat
deliberately, he began, &quot;At the Shimbashi station of Yedo,
where, since many notable officers were to accompany me, a
great crowd of well-wishers thronged to say farewell, I soon
discerned the dark face and the proud head of your father,
Onda Tetsujo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paused, smiling slightly. The girl said nothing, only
bent forward a little, her face full of unconscious excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Close behind him, gentle, clinging, self-effacing, as a good
wife should always be, I saw&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, forgetting her breeding, fairly snatched the words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
from his mouth. &quot;My mother,&mdash;I know, Lord, it was my
dear mother! And the old nurse Suzumè, was she there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was, indeed, a female something that incessantly
bowed, and drew breath with a ferocity that drowned the
hissing of the engine. Has that the air of Suzumè?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, her very self. Oh, how can I wait to get back
home! Ten weeks, Lord, before I am to start!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The words uttered by your parents were these,&mdash;I may
not recall the exact terms, but I have their purpose clear.
First, Iriya said: &#39;Tell to our child that empty hearts and a
cheerless home ache through this night of absence, for her
coming.&#39; Her soft eyes touched my heart, though men call
me stern. Ere I could bow assent, your father Tetsujo&mdash;ah
ha! that old kerai, the unreconstructed feudal knight!&mdash;pushed
rudely past, and cried to me, &#39;Taint memory with no
such puerile demand, my Lord! Say to the girl that hearts
and aches are nothing. As long as I have yen to forward,
let her remain until she is fitted, though a woman, to be of
some slight service to her land. I pray you, Lord, to judge of
her. Should she need to stay full ten years longer, I would
not repine. I have no son. She is the substitute. Empty
hearts, aching nights, bah! Crumbling barley sugar of a
weak spirit! Midzu-amè in a human jar! Good Iriya, my
wife, I advise you to cease your prayers before concessive
deities, and learn to worship more sincerely our God of War.
He is to be the flaming incarnation of this epoch!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can see&mdash;I hear them both,&quot; said Yuki. &quot;My father
is right,&mdash;though the tears that must have stung my mother&#39;s
eyes do now sting mine. Lord, shall you think me fit to go
to such a father? I have done what the Americans call&mdash;graduate.
I have even received prizes for good study.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do they offer prizes here for doing duty? An immoral
practice, especially for the young,&mdash;instilling envy, cupidity.
But it concerns me not. Your question, Yuki,&mdash;are you
fitted to return? I cannot give myself time to be satisfied
entirely with the fitness; but, for other reasons, I am well
aware that it is time for you to return. His Excellency, Mr.
Todd, spoke of the first of the New Year. I wish it were
to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
&quot;Lord,&quot; faltered the girl, &quot;are your august utterances
heavy with reproof? Have you charges of misconduct
against me?&quot; Her guilty heart ran, as a thief for a hidden
treasure, to the thought of Pierre Le Beau and the half-troth
her weakness had allowed him to secure. The next words of
the great man relieved her strangely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, nay, little one, I have heard of no wrong. Look
not so fearful; one would think me Emma-O, the Lord of
Hell, in the flesh. My thought was chiefly that, just now, even
your present acquirements might serve Nippon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, it is of war you hint! Here, many believe that it will
not come. Is it to come, Lord?&quot; She had drawn very close.
Haganè perceived, as one looking at a picture, the exquisite
balance of features in the pointed oval face, the pale width of
brow under clouds of dusty hair, the refinement, the trembling
sensitiveness of lips and chin. His eyes held a certain
keen, inscrutable intentness of regard. The corners now
wrinkled slightly with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A nightingale studies not with a maker of swords,&quot; he
said slowly. &quot;Yet may the nightingale&#39;s note give warning
where the sword could not avail. What one has not heard,
cannot be told. It is a time when the whispering of leaves is
to be shunned, and the fall of the petals counted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki caught her underlip between her teeth to steady its
trembling. Again she felt reproved, though nothing could be
kinder than the great man&#39;s voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four years,&quot; he mused aloud, &quot;four years! Small space
of time to us who are on the heights,&mdash;but to the young,
still wandering happily on flowered-covered slopes, it is long,
quite long. Ah, little Yuki, it is but yesterday that you came,
as a child, to my Tabata villa. You clung timidly, at first, to
Tetsujo&#39;s hand; but the serving-maids soon won you to the
air. After that, at my request, Tetsujo brought you often.
You were a scarlet poppy turned loose in that dim old garden.
My eye would follow you through passages of the good
Tetsujo&#39;s somewhat prosy discourse. You used to perch
upon the gray rocks of the pond, and fish for hours, throwing
back the small wriggling bits of gold as soon as caught. Do
you remember, Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
&quot;Yes, Lord, well do I remember,&quot; said Yuki, her mouth
trembling into laughter. The self-consciousness faded. He
knew that it would be so. It was for this that he had contrived
the long speech of reminiscence. &quot;Once,&quot; she went on
shyly, &quot;once, into that pond I fell, screaming with terror to
think that certainly, now, all the goldfish would make haste
to bite their enemy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Their best revenge, I take it, was in the cold you caught,&quot;
laughed the prince.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, Highness,&quot; said she, gravely, &quot;no cold at all did I
acquire. The maid-servants and thy divine, pitying princess
rescued me. They changed my worthless garments, and urged
upon me much hot tea and a small, sweet powder. Indeed,
but for the trouble my clumsiness occasioned, I enjoyed more
the falling into that august pond than the fishing beside it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè smiled a little abstractedly. He did not laugh
again. He turned to the table and smoothed the corners of a
document. &quot;The villa has no princess now, my child. In
my many houses I come and go alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki looked upon the floor. &quot;My spirit is poisoned by
your sorrow, Lord. Forgive my great rudeness in mentioning.
I did not know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He drew a short, impatient sigh. &quot;The princess resides
again with her own people in Choshiu. But these matters
have interest for none but me. Hark, is that not the hour
of noon now striking? I must dismiss you.&quot; She rose instantly
at his words. He followed with more deliberation.
She turned to the door, then wavered back to him, distressed
evidently by thoughts she shrank from voicing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speak, child,&quot; he said kindly, &quot;no mad haste is necessary.
Say what you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still she moved soundless lips. In some inexplicable way
she had fallen short. It was not only that she felt she had
not reached his highest expectations, but, more definitely, she
had failed to reach her own. Her acquired Americanism
crackled on her, like a useless husk. She thirsted for new
strength. Before her stood one able to give it, yet she could
find no words to ask. &quot;It is ten&mdash;weeks before I can start
home, Lord,&quot; she managed at last to articulate. &quot;I am only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
a girl, but I would die for Nippon, for my Emperor. What&mdash;what&mdash;&quot;
Again she faltered.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè took a small hand in his own and smiled reassurance.
&quot;Only the very young and inexperienced think it
necessary to state willingness to die for a country. Give
me the coming thought.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In these last weeks what can I do,&mdash;what can I suffer,&mdash;how
shall I pray,&mdash;that I may make myself worthy of
return?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The smile on the overhung dark face saddened into a look
far tenderer than smiling. Yuki felt virtue, like a fluid, rush
through her from his touch. &quot;Keep always to the thought
that you are Nipponese,&mdash;that you guard, in yourself, an immortal
spirit, powerful for good or ill. Let not the tendrils
of your outreaching soul cling to alien ideals, for, if so, each
in the twining means a wrench and a scar, and the unscarred
soul is sweeter to the gods. Think nothing of the body,&mdash;of
personal desires, of personal reward. Say to yourself
always, &#39;It is enough to be a Nipponese.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki was already stilled and comforted. &quot;Lord,&quot; she said,
lifting brave eyes, &quot;I think it true that the lowliest among
us, through self-striving, may become a god. My little spark
of light has slept until this moment. I can never again be
quite the same girl who came into this room. I will curve
the memory of your words about my spirit, as one shields his
candle from a wind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In Nippon I see you next, my Yuki. And now, &#39;Sayonara,&#39;
till that time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sayonara,&quot; whispered Yuki, and hurried out into a new
day.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Preparations</span> for an unexpectedly early start kept the Todd
family in a condition of strained excitement. When the tension
did relax (Mrs. Todd had more than once warned them),
they would all probably shoot off into eternity, mere dull bits
of leaden weight, as from a boy&#39;s rubber sling. Yet in these
days the good lady had little time for speculations, whether
mournful or the reverse. She, Gwendolen, and Yuki began at
once a round of shopping and dressmaking. Officious lady
friends who had lived or visited in Japan hastened to tell of
certain articles necessary to the civilized female which, absolutely,
were not to be procured in Japan. At first Mrs. Todd
hearkened eagerly, and made lists for future shopping; but she
invariably lost the lists, and, after the first week, began to
notice that some particular item declared by one gesticulating
visitor to be unpurchasable west of San Francisco, would, by
the next, be named as a thing produced in full perfection only
by Yokohama cobblers, jewellers, cabinet-makers, tanners, or
tailors, as the case might be.</p>

<p class="indent">Much in the same manner, whereas one matron declared the
Japanese servant a fiend, laden with an accumulation of domestic
vices from the days of Pharaoh down, the next would
congratulate Mrs. Todd on being about to enter upon an experience
rare to this hemisphere,&mdash;perfect service, intelligently
and cheerfully given.</p>

<p class="indent">The pleasant home on M street was abandoned, the occupants
moving to a hotel. This was done that Mrs. Todd
might personally supervise the packing and storing of furnishings
grown dear through pleasant association. More than
one stealthy tear plashed on an unresponsive packing-case.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen&#39;s brimming joy gave room for but one regret.
That lived and died in a single glance, as she saw her grand
piano, ignominiously tilted, pathetically legless, carried past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
her through the wide front door, and down to the waiting
hearse of a van.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd went to bed, during this strenuous period, immediately
after dinner. She urged her daughter to follow the
good example and get &quot;rested&quot; for struggles to come. But
&quot;No,&quot; said Gwendolen, laughing. &quot;There will be plenty of
time to rest when I&#39;m old. I can&#39;t waste life now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Many of the girl&#39;s evening hours were devoted to Mr. Dodge
and what he was pleased to term &quot;Lessons in Japanese.&quot;
When Yuki and Pierre were present,&mdash;Yuki now resided permanently
at the Japanese Legation,&mdash;the Oriental listener
would often need to bury a crimsoning face in crumpled sleeves
to hide her mirth. Mr. Dodge&#39;s vocabulary was large, especially
in the way of amorous and complimentary phrases, but his
syntax and his pronunciation were things new on this planet.
Pierre laughed too, with a superiority born of Yuki&#39;s private
instruction. Gwendolen stoutly defended her professor, saying
that his way of speaking the language sounded easier and
more natural than Yuki&#39;s own.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dodge, by one of those fortuitous happenings that lay,
for him, like pebbles, in every chosen path, had found that he
would be compelled to return to his post of duty by the same
steamer on which the Todds were to sail. When he made
this bold announcement, accompanied by a triumphant side-glance
at Gwendolen, the girl was surprised to feel her heart
give a warning throb. Despite her skill in the game and her
audacity, she began to realize that in this young person she
had probably met her equal. She rallied quickly in the face of
danger. Exhilaration took the place of fear. She knew she
was in for a good fight, and began at once to employ her other
admirers in the way of Indian clubs and dumb-bells. Dodge
very properly went home to South Carolina a few weeks
before sailing, and did not return to Washington until the
time of final departure.</p>

<p class="indent">If Yuki trembled at thought of her long days on an enchanted
voyage, with Pierre for closest comrade, her new
strength, born of Haganè, smiled down the apprehension.
Not only would she refuse to yield to that beloved one a
deeper pledge, but, if possible, she would win back from him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
the half-troth already given. She longed to return to her
country, to her people, free of obligation. Her reverence
demanded it. She should belong only to herself and them.
So should she have a clearer road in which to approach the
subject of a foreign marriage. Pierre, as yet, refused to see
this vital point. He must be made to see. On those long
balmy evenings on the ship, with the moon&#39;s sweet influence
to help her, yes,&mdash;she could convince him,&mdash;she would
triumph!</p>

<p class="indent">While Senator Todd made his own few preparations, talked
with all manner of congressmen on the ever-present topic of
the threatened Far Eastern conflict, or reasoned with brother
senators who decried so unconventional a thing as resignation
from their august midst,&mdash;Pierre harassed the French Legation
for confirmation of an appointment almost given, yet now,
at the last, tantalizingly withheld. After insistent efforts, the
best that he could gain was assurance that, in Tokio itself,
in the hands of Count Ronsard, the present French minister,
he would almost surely find his credentials waiting. Pierre,
at his princess-mother&#39;s instigation had written personally to
this Count Ronsard. &quot;An old, dear friend of ours, mon
fils,&quot; wrote Madame Olga. &quot;Quite close, I assure you. He
will be felicitated to offer what he can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre and Yuki in their many talks had come to believe
that an assured diplomatic position in Tokio would greatly
strengthen their chances for an early marriage. Their young
ardors were to blow the drowsy coals of French and Japanese
friendship. Their lives must have an influence for good!
At such times the future glowed with a heavenly dawn. Pierre,
ever since his arrival in Washington, little less than a year
ago, had been a special favorite with Mrs. Todd. In the
first place, he was a joy only to look upon, having personal
beauty to a degree almost irritating in a man. He possessed,
also, that subtler and rarer power called &quot;charm.&quot; A great
factor in his success was unfailing courtesy toward elderly
women. He knew well the might of the chaperon. He cared
little for men in any country, and the aggressive American
he found peculiarly unattractive. But a woman, no matter
what her age, race, or weight, was still a woman. Middleaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
sighs fed his vanity equally with the giggling of débutantes
in their first snare. He was not a Don Juan, far from
it,&mdash;but a pleasure-loving, life-loving boy, who had never
been refused a thing he wanted, and never intended to grudge
himself a moment&#39;s delight that could be honorably enjoyed.
His ideas of this honor,&mdash;it may be well to add,&mdash;were
French. At different stages in his short career, Pierre had
been or tried to be, in turn, a hermit, an atheist, a Roman
Catholic priest like Francis of Assisi, an actor of old French
classics, a poet, and an artist of the Chavannes school. With
him one passion burned supreme. One fuse must disappear
before a new one could be lighted. He had met Yuki first
in the Todd drawing-rooms, on one of those Friday evenings
allotted to the schoolgirls for receiving friends. She chanced
to be wearing full Japanese attire of a soft, cloudy blue,
a sash brocaded in silver ferns, and a cluster of the gold-colored
&quot;icho&quot; berries drooping in her blue-black hair. As his
eyes fell upon her, Pierre&#39;s past visions went to cold ash. All
the poetry, the mysticism, the intellectuality, the exaggeration
of discarded hopes flared now into a single new white flame
of adoration.</p>

<p class="indent">December came. Christmas festivities impinged on the
travellers&#39; routine of preparations. Days which, at first,
Gwendolen had declared interminable, accelerated strangely
in progress, like round stones started down a gradual slope.
During that last crowded week, Todd had his final, most important
interview with the President and the Secretary of State.
He was urged to impart with absolute freedom his personal
opinions of the coming struggle, and its probable outcome for
the world. In return he was given full and satisfactory instructions.
He left the executive mansion strengthened in
purpose, and clarified in his own beliefs.</p>

<p class="indent">At the station, on the morning of departure, an unexpectedly
large crowd gathered to say &quot;Farewell.&quot; Prominent were
the Kanrios and their diplomatic suite. Gwendolen&#39;s youthful
friends of both sexes advanced like an animated flower-garden,
so profuse were the bouquets. The French ambassador
also was there. A Russian attaché insisted upon kissing
Pierre good-bye.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
The two drawing-rooms of the sleeper &quot;Nurino&quot; were so
heaped with dulcet offerings that the legitimate occupants&mdash;hurrying
in to the warning cry of &quot;Buo-o-o-ord!&quot;&mdash;were
forced to seek temporary accommodation in the open car.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why! It&#39;s just like setting off for anywhere!&quot; cried
Gwendolen, a little blankly, as the train drew out through
acrid smoke, and old familiar landmarks began their flight
backward, to the city.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who cares about the setting off? It&#39;s the roosting on,
that counts!&quot; carolled the optimistic Dodge.</p>

<p class="indent">The train pulled steadily, now, for the South. After much
disagreement and discussion, and the bending of yellow, black,
and brown heads over countless railroad folders,&mdash;each with
its own route in a pulsing artery of red,&mdash;they had decided
for a southern tour. No one of the party except Dodge, who,
if one chose to believe him, held acquaintance with all corners
of the globe, had been lower than the Potomac River. Mrs.
Todd remembered an aunt, native of New Orleans. The aunt
had died long since, but the city remained. They were to
have a glimpse of the Gulf Coast, and at least two days in the
sleepy, picturesque, yet hugely prosperous Crescent City.</p>

<p class="indent">The month was January, in most places a bad month for
weather; but in this opening of the year 1904 the South was
apparently bent upon justifying its conventional adjective of
&quot;sunny.&quot; The little party left Washington in a scourge of
sleet and a pall of gray; it reached New Orleans to find the
whole city, creole alleys traced three centuries ago and broad
avenues of later wealth, alike glorified,&mdash;&quot;paved with afternoon.&quot;
Scarcely a gulf breeze stirred. The levees by the
muddy river lay like saurians, with turpentine and sugar
barrels and bursting cotton bales upon their backs, in lieu of
scales. In city gardens, palm-trees stood at &quot;present arms&quot;
of glossy rectitude. Pansies, daisies, and other small bedding
flowers bloomed in the open air. Potted ferns or crotons
stood about on broad galleries, or upon the shell-white walks
bordering emerald lawns.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen declared it a delusion, a mirage, deliberately
planned for their entanglement. Yuki admitted that even
Japan could not offer so tropic a feast to the eye in January.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
Mrs. Todd found her greatest satisfaction in &quot;doing&quot; the
place. Dodge, of course, was cicerone. He led them to the
old French market and gave them a strange, steaming elixir,
brewed in huge copper vats and misnamed mere &quot;coffee.&quot; He
knew the small lair called &quot;Beguet&#39;s,&quot; where alone on earth,
he solemnly affirmed, real breakfasts were to be procured.
He hired a box at the French Opera for Sunday night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunday!&quot; Mrs. Todd gasped, with upraised hands and eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunday!&quot; echoed Yuki, less vociferously, but with a corresponding
air of pained astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainement!&quot; ejaculated Pierre, who was beginning to
feel at home. &quot;It is transplanted Paris. Why not Sunday
night, better than another? All persons have been to mass,
except our naughty selves. The piety of the others may
chance to include us. God is good! Allons! The opera is
Faust, with the full ballet and music. Time means little
here! Vive New Orleans!&quot; After a laughing glance into
Mrs. Todd&#39;s still dubious countenance he whispered, insinuatingly,
&quot;It is never to be known in Washington or&mdash;Tokio&mdash;dear
Madame.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the end he carried his point and his party. Never had
he been in such spirits. Yuki could scarcely keep her eyes
from his radiant face. Mr. Todd declared him a mineral
spring that had just blown its way through a boulder. He
stopped turbaned mammies or wondering children on the
banquets,&mdash;which in New Orleans means sidewalks,&mdash;that he
might elicit, by his correct Parisian French, answers in the
delicious native patois. At each success he hugged himself
anew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ç&#39;est ça, même! Mo pas geignin l&#39;argent pour butin çi
lalà!&quot; he murmured ecstatically. &quot;Geignin plein!&quot; Passing
the cathedral, Pierre asked of a lounging, large-hipped negress:
&quot;Est-ce qu&#39;il y à la messe à la Cathédrale demain?&quot; to
receive the impudent answer:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sainte Pitie! Est-çe que vous croire que le va levé apres
so&#39; bon diner au poisson pou&#39; vini donner nous autres la sainte
messe? Bon Dieu la Sainte Vierge! Ha! Ha!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Holy Mother! But it is French, en glacé,&mdash;crushed,
with the cream swimming and the flavor heightened!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
Todd alone stared out across the dim, majestic river
through De Soto&#39;s eyes. He tried to feel himself the man, to
prophesy as that seer had prophesied. The great city and the
long levees were builded in that vanished mind, before the
first adobe brick was moulded, or the first dark cedar hewn.
Now in himself, as Todd the new American minister, he felt
the country of his dreams creep nearer, lured by the magnet
of the Panama Canal. Within his own life, should God be
pleased to spare him to a fair old age, new craft would thread
the Mississippi delta, small merchantmen at first, and sailing
vessels, each with the banner of the red sun on its mast.
Asiatic labor, silent, skilful, insidious, would contest for preeminence
with the saturnine Dago, the &quot;cayjin,&quot; the Quadroon,
and the established African.</p>

<p class="indent">Each moment, westward from the city, held a novelty and a
delight. The sugar-fields of Louisiana, stretching for leaden-colored
miles, and soon to be pierced by myriad tiny spears
of awakening green, appeared to Yuki a giant sort of rice-field
from her own land.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it were cut up into many small piece, all of different
shape and size, with little crooked baby-levees binding the
edges,&mdash;it would be exacterlee the winter rice-fields of
Nippon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes, in an island of higher ground, the white-columned
house of a sugar-planter gleamed, and near it rose
mammoth live oaks, huge tumuli of green, the underbranches
swaying with grizzled moss. In the open country, such trees
crouched low above stealthy creeks, or blotted widening
lagoons.</p>

<p class="indent">While in the city, they had read and heard of recent heavy
rains to the West, flooding a wide agricultural district. On
the borderland of Texas, they knew they had reached the
threatened fields. Cypress, magnolia, sweet gum, and bay
trees stood knee deep in a sea of dull chrome, churned from
roads of clay. It seemed a lake of yellow onyx. Between
the trunks writhed a tropical disorder of vines, palmetto, and
undergrowth. In wide, clear spaces, drifting fence rails or
half-submerged buildings told of ruin already accomplished.
Now the whole unstable sea was covered by a carpet of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
floating &quot;water-hyacinth,&quot; which, in later months, was to
turn the bayous and lagoons into veins of amethyst. It
seemed incredible to the little party, staring solemnly from
train windows, that they were in temperate America at all.
Every floating spar of wood became an alligator&#39;s head, every
springing tuft of white swamp flower a meditative stork.</p>

<p class="indent">Night fell swiftly upon the watery forest, sucked down into
it as to a familiar lair. With the next morning, the world
had changed to a dry desert, above which arched an unrelated
sky.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can we really be on the same planet?&quot; asked Gwendolen;
&quot;or in the night, did this little measuring-worm of a train
reach up and pull itself to Mars?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before, behind, everywhere, stretched spaces of exhausted
gray sand, rising now and again into nerveless hills. For
vegetation were set innumerable rosettes of the spiked yucca,
with small heaps of the prickly pear, a cactus bush built up
of fleshy bulbs, leaf out of leaf, like inflated green coral. On
some of the thorny ridges perched star-like, yellow blooms.
On others were stuck thick, purple fingers, known politely by
the name of &quot;figs.&quot; Dodge remarked sententiously that it
was a very interesting plant; though, by raisers of cattle, not
considered desirable. &quot;Stock won&#39;t eat it a little bit,&quot; he
explained cherubically. &quot;Get stickers into their noses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you call that thing a plant?&quot; cried Gwendolen, pointing.
&quot;It may grow, but it is no more a plant than a canary
is a crab.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge smiled again, the irritating smile of the well-informed.
&quot;Wait till to-morrow in Arizona, if you want to
know how it feels to be struck dumb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen tossed her head. Her tendency during these
initial days was to overact indifference.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I rather think I shall not undergo the humiliation of
incapacity to speak! Life heretofore has brought no crises
in which I could not command a fairly adequate linguistic
expression of my visual experiences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whew,&mdash;how did you remember it all?&quot; said Dodge
under his breath. Yuki turned her intense face from the
window. At sight of the absorbed, half-dazed expression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
Gwendolen gave a little laugh, crying, &quot;Here is one already
nearing the borders of silence! That is Yuki&#39;s way. When
she begins to feel things, she draws back in her shell, and puts
sealing-wax on the door. What is it now, Yuki,&mdash;lack of
English,&mdash;that keeps you so dumb?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not exacterlee,&quot; said Yuki, flushing a little at the
turning of all eyes. &quot;I have not good English, of course; but
I could not say to myself all that I see, even in Nipponese.
When too many new thing come, it is like fat people trying
to squeeze together through a door,&mdash;all get mashed, and
none come through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge gazed at the speaker in quizzical admiration. &quot;Miss
Onda, I long for a phonograph record. That is a masterly
exposition of a profound psychological truth!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki cast a laughing, half-pathetic glance toward Pierre.
&quot;Is it very bad names that he is calling me, M. Le Beau?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of Gwendolen&#39;s hyperbolic boast, Arizona, next day,
came near to fulfilling Dodge&#39;s prophecy. The world stretched
bigger and broader, as though here, instead of at the Arctic
poles, the &quot;flattening-like-an-orange&quot; of our globe took place.
The sky, immeasurably remote and tangibly arched, was a thin
crystal dome soldered to earth by the lead-line of the horizon.
The red sand was hot to look at. The hills, though of vaster
proportions, had more of helplessness and degeneracy in their
sprawling curves. Yucca grew very closely now, marching up
and down the slopes like fierce explosive little soldiers with
bayonets too long for them. The objectionable prickly pears
vanished. In their places rose a stranger order of being, cacti
in tangled bunches, as of green serpents, sometimes with the
licking red tongue of a blossom,&mdash;hunched woolly lambs of
growth on high, thin stilts of shaggy black,&mdash;huge green
melons, ribbed, spiked, and lazy, that seemed strangely at ease
on their burning couches of sand. Far off, against the rim of
nothingness, dry, blue mountain shapes emerged, mere tissue
filaments of hue. And now, as part of the unreal perspective,
giant cacti rose, at first no more than scratches and cross-marks
on a window-pane, but coming steadily close. The first
that flashed, tall, stark, and tangible, into the very faces of
those who watched, brought small exclamations of wonder and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
distaste. It passed instantaneously, fleeing backward into
nothingness,&mdash;a herald to proclaim the coming horde. In a
few moments, imagination, the sunshine, and the day became
mere mediums for the aggressive race. This scorched eternity
was made for them. Isolated and defiant, their laws were to
themselves. It seemed a deliberate assumption that they
should mock reality, taking on the evil forms of crucifix, gallows,
skeleton-trees, and mile-posts, where nothing but a famished
death was to be pointed. The desert might have been
a vast sea-bottom, set with grim coral trees and hardened
polyps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are a race of evil spirits, petrified,&quot; whispered Gwendolen.
&quot;I feel their sinister association with our human life.
See what shapes they have chosen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Yuki in return, and caught Gwendolen&#39;s hand
as if for comfort. &quot;You are right, Gwendolen. I think it is
a Buddhist hell of trees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what could cause this doom to befall an innocent tree,
little sister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be evil karma,&quot; said Yuki, with wide yet shrinking
eyes upon the desert. &quot;Perhaps a tree where a blameless
man was hanged, perhaps the tree of a martyr&#39;s sacrifice,&mdash;perhaps
even,&mdash;&quot; here her voice fell to an intense and dramatic
whisper which chilled her listeners while it stirred
them, &quot;perhaps that terrible&mdash;terrible tree whereon our&mdash;Saviour&mdash;See&mdash;see!
now, over there&mdash;there&mdash;where on
top of a hill three great crosses, the middle one so great
and black and high,&mdash;is it not Gethsemane?&quot; She pointed
with a shaking finger, unable to utter more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Yuki, do not look&mdash;I forbid it!&quot; cried Pierre,
vehemently. In a moment, with a shudder, he added, &quot;Albrecht
Dürer might have dreamed them in a nightmare, had
he killed his own child and slept afterward! Mother of God!
I shall look no more!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor I either, Pierre,&quot; cried Mrs. Todd, in great relief.
&quot;You are right to correct Yuki,&mdash;she does have such morbid
fancies. I&#39;ve heard her tell stories of ghosts, and incarnations,
and those scary things that would make the flesh creep on
your bones. Thank heaven, this day is nearly done! Ugh!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
See how the lengthening shadows spread them on the sand!&quot;
Deliberately she pulled down the small window-shade, leaned
back, and closed her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the matter, dear? Are you faint?&quot; asked Mr.
Todd, bending over her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but I&#39;m thirsty. Ring for some lemonades, Cy.
This dust has made my throat as dry as a lime-burner&#39;s
wig!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen rose. &quot;Well, you can have your lemonades,
but I am going to watch the desert until night drives down
the last black cactus-peg. It&#39;s a thing to remember!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Voilà! It&#39;s a thing to forget,&quot; challenged Pierre. &quot;Nay,
Yuki-ko, you must not follow. Tears are on your cheeks.
Stay here, and let us talk of your beautiful land, forgetting
the harsh ugliness outside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He, too, leaned over, and pulled down a shade. Yuki made
a slight motion of protest, then submitted. &quot;Yes, let us talk
of the umè-flowers,&quot; she whispered. &quot;They are the first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen had taken a seat to herself at the far end of the
open compartment. Here, alone, she watched the red sands
smoulder into gray. For a brief half-hour the plant shadows
stretched elastically into a network of black. Suddenly they
sank, as water, into the sand. The upright stalks themselves
began to waver and lose shape. An instant more and they
would have vanished like their shadows; but now, in the
western sky, just where the heated disc of copper had been
lowered, an aftermath of glory mocked the night. The cactus
forms, against the gleam, acquired new menace and fresh exaggeration.
The brightness shut down quickly, like a box-lid,
and a universe of stars sprang out. Tangled in their
beams, again loomed up the cacti.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fair maid, thy summons to the lemonade!&quot; said Dodge,
close behind her. &quot;By Jove! I almost committed a rhyme!
Fair maid,&mdash;lemonade,&mdash;good combination, think I&#39;ll write
it on my cuff.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last the girl turned from her desert.</p>

<p class="indent">Next day, to the outspoken satisfaction of Mrs. Todd, aridity
had begun to retreat before civilization. Even the small
spot called Yuma seemed, with its station garden of green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
a bit of Paradise. Before reaching it, Dodge had carefully
printed a large notice, using the top of one of Gwendolen&#39;s
florist boxes. This he hung in full view of all, at the end of
the car.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We approach <span class="smcap">Yuma</span>. No puns aloud. First offence, one
bottle. Second offence, five bottles. Third offence, a whole
case. By Order of the General Manager.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The few other travellers destined for the long California
journey were, by this time, all on friendly terms. No one
could have resisted the combined gayeties of Gwendolen,
Dodge, and Pierre Le Beau. Yuki, though less responsive,
was, as usual, an object both of interest and admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">In lower California Mrs. Todd averred that at last she was
in America. The trip up the coast, with glimpses of Narragansett
surf springing up in dazzling whiteness between rows
of eucalyptus, pepper, and live-oak trees, or over the roofs of
tiled adobe houses, could not turn her from the belief.</p>

<p class="indent">Near San Jose, cottages peered out from arching vines of
rose. Gwendolen was distressed and surprised to find that
roses, here, did not bloom continuously, and always in abundance.
&quot;They must show like glaciers, when they do come,&quot;
she admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">With San Francisco, modern life, society, stress, began,
anew. Old acquaintances sent in cards. Gwendolen began
a whole volume of new admirers, while Yuki, with Pierre as
escort, found certain Japanese friends and acquaintances, one
the child of an old family servant of her father&#39;s house.</p>

<p class="indent">To many thousands of voyagers, San Francisco is but a
stopping place, a bird-rest for preening. As a fact it is a city
which possesses an unusual share of individuality, of &quot;atmosphere,&quot;
in the sense that writers use. No where else are to be
seen such gray and wind-swept streets, where houses stand
sidewise, as if mounting flights of stairs, the parlor windows
of one house looking through the chimney-pots of its neighbor.
Nowhere else are perched palaces like those of San Francisco,
or a growth, as huge and strange in its exotic coloring, as
Chinatown. The great, round, shimmering bay and Golden
Gate are as a loom, and ships of the harbor, shuttles weaving
together the nations of East and West.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
On sailing day, new friends and new flowers gave the little
party of the Todds &quot;bon voyage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If New Orleans is a transplanted Paris, this is a Tschaikowsky
Symphonie Orientale translated into terms of American
life,&quot; said Pierre.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the city turned from a city to a patch of lichen on
a rock. Queer little ditches, which they knew for streets,
showed lines of perpendicular-crawling beetles, which they
recognized to be whizzing electric cars. They watched it all
eagerly, leaning far along the stern rail of the ship.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the sea winds caught them, screaming a welcome into
shrinking ears. The white, attendant sea-gulls laughed in
harsh appreciation of the antics of the wind. The ocean lifted,
and strove, and pounded his cosmic greeting; and,&mdash;and,&mdash;well&mdash;there
was a good stewardess on board!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> first days of any voyage are admirable in proportion
as little, or nothing, is said of them. In this, as in other
phases of human intercourse, delicacy lies in restraint rather
than in eloquence. Thus is the bloom of society preserved.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dodge, the self-confident, the experienced, the ubiquitous,
was first to &quot;show up.&quot; The outer reefs of the California
coast do not tend toward placidity. Even Dodge did
not care to count the hours since he had begun to feel &quot;sleepy&quot;
and had sought his cabin.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Todd next met the sun. To be more accurate, it was a
fog, where only a small bright spot, rubbed as in the centre of
a tarnished tray, indicated our chief luminary. Todd&#39;s cap was
pulled very low, his ulster collar very high. His hands disappeared
utterly into large pockets. He walked with the
jerky directness of a marionette toward the smoking-room.</p>

<p class="indent">On the third day, when the sun actually shone and the pewter
sky was undergoing a gradual transformation into blue enamel,
Mr. Todd was able to sit on deck,&mdash;he still remained noticeably
near the smoking-room,&mdash;and to enjoy unprintable yarns
from fellow-smokers. Missionary children began to gambol
around the promenade deck, and over the feet of swathed and
flaccid mortals, lately exhumed, all with the blinking regard
of insects suddenly disclosed beneath a garden stone. Dodge,
for a wonder, was not in sight. Mr. Todd had his back toward
the main-deck exit from the salon, when one of the group
about him thumped a knee, stared up, crying, &quot;By G&mdash;, look
at that!&quot; and called loudly upon his Maker to witness that
the sight was fair.</p>

<p class="indent">Out to the deck had blown a golden apparition,&mdash;a tall, slim
girl with yellow hair crushed under a wide and most unsailor-like
hat of yellow sea-poppies. Her skirts and the rest of her
were silken browns and yellows. She made straight for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
group, rustling like a small eddy in a heap of autumn-leaves.
Todd turned a few inches. At the expression on his face a third
convive nudged the speaker. &quot;Oh, er&mdash;beg ten thousand
pardons&mdash;didn&#39;t have an idea&mdash;&quot; mumbled the crimson
one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither did I,&quot; said Todd, enigmatically, as he rose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dearest of dads,&quot; they heard a fresh voice cry. &quot;Now
isn&#39;t this a world with the top off? I feel like a bunk caterpillar
turned into a butterfly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre followed his three emancipated comrades, immediately
after &quot;tiffin,&quot; as the midday meal hereafter must be called.
He was, as usual, immaculate in attire, but bore an air of
citric melancholy.</p>

<p class="indent">Next arose, in all her might, Mrs. Cyrus Carton Todd. In
her aggressive costume of starched piqué, fortified by gold
lorgnettes and an air carefully adapted from certain acknowledged
&quot;grandes dames&quot; of Washington, she took immediate
possession of the Captain, the best deck chair, and the passenger
list. As wife of a senator and lady of the new American
minister to Japan, she was accepted at once, without demur,
reigning Empress of the voyage.</p>

<p class="indent">Sportive infants, oblivious of comfortably extended limbs of
lesser mortals, skirted those of Mrs. Todd. Silent Chinese
&quot;boys,&quot; dispensing beef-tea and gruel, swung pigtails aside
from her austere garments.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the party Yuki alone now abode in the mysterious seclusion
of her stateroom.</p>

<p class="indent">Before sunset, on that third afternoon, the sea, to use the
Captain&#39;s expression, quieted into a &quot;bloomin&#39; mill-pond.&quot;
White birds fluttered incessantly about the stern of the ship,
sometimes sinking to the waves for an unstable rest, or rising
to visit, in one great silver swoop, the startled and delighted
passenger deck.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre found a chair beside his chaperon. He moved it a
confidential three inches nearer before asking, &quot;Will she not
be able to come up sometime before to-morrow? This is
perfect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has commissioned me to say that she will try to make
the effort this evening, after our dinner; that is, if&mdash;&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
here she shook a playful finger&mdash;&quot;<i>if</i> I will play propriety, and
any kindly disposed person could be found to assist her
upstairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! I&#39;ll go down now, and take seat upon her doormat,&quot;
cried Pierre, in his excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Chinese coolie might spill chicken broth upon you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The day waned slowly. Passengers were beginning already
their postprandial walks. Mrs. Todd nodded patronizingly
to one and then to another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame,&quot; began Pierre, with his caressing look, &quot;you
have been almost as a mother&mdash;a good, indulgent mother&mdash;to
me in that big land of yours. You will continue to be my
very good friend in Japan, will you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, silly boy, of course I will,&quot; she cried. &quot;Have not I
always been your friend and Yuki&#39;s,&mdash;even to the point of
what Cyrus called &#39;entangling alliances&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is because of its preciousness that I want to hear you
say it, dear Mrs. Todd. After all, I am ignorant of Japan, and
of what social phantoms Yuki and I may have to fight. But
with your championship, I am strong, invincible!&quot; He gave
her fat hand just the most delicate of pressures. It might
have been the touch of a devoted son; it might, had Mrs. Todd
been twenty years younger, have been&mdash;well, almost anything.
His dark, impassioned eyes, the color of new-opened violets,
hung on her kindly face.</p>

<p class="indent">If fault could be found with Pierre, it would be in excess of
beauty. From the old blood of France he had received refinement,
poise, delicacy,&mdash;the throbbing of purple veins in
temples as satin-smooth as young leaves, and thin nostrils
that shivered at every passing gust of emotion. From the
more barbaric, vivid Russian mother had come depth of coloring,
the flash of sudden animation, deep blue in the eyes, and
gold in the hair. Yet with all its fairness the face was not
effeminate. One could think of it, without offence, in the
armor of a young crusader, or even behind the mediæval visor
of a robber-baron. There might be a hint of cruelty behind
the wet crimson of the perfect mouth. To Yuki that face
was the epitome of all earthly beauty. Before it, the artist in
her knelt, in adoration.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
Shortly after twilight came the reverberating clamor of
the first dinner-gong. Mrs. Todd and her feminine satellites
had agreed to &quot;dress.&quot; Mrs. Todd had never made acquaintance
with a décolleté gown until her entrance into Washington,
not so many years before. Now she was wont to declare
loudly that she could not really enjoy her evening meal in
covered shoulders,&mdash;a statement which always brought the
twinkles to Todd&#39;s eyes. He openly loathed his &quot;tombstone
shirt-front;&quot; but Gwendolen, of a later and more favored generation,
wore her pretty low-cut frocks as unconsciously as a
flower wears its sheath.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre sat through the interminable courses, scarcely knowing
what he ate or to whom he spoke. His thoughts were all
with Yuki. He was to see her again after three endless days!
The little cool, slim palm would lie, perhaps, in his. He
would hear her voice, as different from these chattering table
women all around him as is the sound of running water to
the whirr of machines. The past ten days of journeying&mdash;though
indeed they had not been for a moment entirely alone&mdash;left
a delicious aroma of familiarity, almost of married
friendship. What hours the future was to hold for them in
Japan, in Europe, in India!</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd&#39;s half-teasing voice drew him back from the dear
reverie. &quot;Come, Mister Le Beau, dinner is over at last. I
noticed that you ate nothing. The Captain has been telling
us the most delightful jokes. But we must not forget our
promise to Miss Onda. Gwendolen, dear, will you go on deck
and see that a chair is made ready for the poor child?&quot; The
speaker had been rising ponderously. She turned again to
the Captain. &quot;These Japanese are always wretched sailors,
I am told.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No good, any of them!&quot; corroborated the Captain, with
emphasis. &quot;The sight of a floral anchor at a landlubber&#39;s
funeral is enough to make them ill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder how it will be with their admirals before the
Russian navy,&quot; mused Todd, with pensive eyes on a blue-gowned
Chinese steward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wouldn&#39;t matter either way,&quot; sneered the Captain.
&quot;No fight is going to come off! I&#39;ve known these Yokohama
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
Japs for seventeen years, Mr. Todd. A bad lot! They are
just trying a game of bluff borrowed from&mdash;no offence,
gentlemen&mdash;from America.&quot; The Captain was a Liverpool
Englishman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just so!&quot; grinned Dodge, &quot;the kind of bluff that works,&mdash;recipe
handed down by one G. Washington.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre and Mrs. Todd approached Yuki&#39;s cabin. She heard
them, and tottered to the entrance of the tiny passage. Her
face shone ghastly white above the square black collar of her
adzuma-coat. Pierre instantly drew her arm within his own.
She clung to him helplessly for an instant, then, with an
obvious effort, rallied and stood erect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, there, now, keep to Pierre&#39;s arm,&quot; encouraged Mrs.
Todd, with the smile of a patron deity. &quot;If you&#39;ll promise to
be good, I&#39;ll go ahead and not look around.&quot; She preceded
them slowly along the passage. Her décolleté back loomed,
in the dim light, like the half of a large, round cheese.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, once safely on deck, tucked lovingly among soft rugs
and pillows by Gwendolen, found little indeed to say. Mrs.
Todd gave orders, before sweeping off to her game of bridge
whist, that Yuki must not be teased into talking, but must lie
still, and let the night air and the breeze refresh her. Pierre,
of course, remained by her side. He cared little though the
whole ship knew that he loved the Japanese girl and longed to
make her his wife. Dodge and Gwendolen had affairs of their
own to settle, and disappeared around the other side. Gradually
the deck was deserted by all but Pierre and his companion.
He secured a small hand in his own. The girl was
too languid, or perhaps too blissful, to demur.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, to be seasick is most unpleasantest thing of all!&quot; she
whispered once, with a short but very genuine shudder. &quot;I
shall never cross back on this water,&mdash;never, never! The
little bed downstairs it seem like a grave, and one wish hard
that it was truly a grave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After another long silence, broken only by whispered sentences
from Pierre, she pointed to a constellation. &quot;How nice
and kind the stars are to come out here with us, so far from
home! That cluster is exactly the same one I used to watch
from my little room at school. When I see it in Japan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
and count the stars to be sure all have followed, it will be
stranger feeling yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darling,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;sometime we are to carry that
little shining group the whole way round the world with us,&mdash;when
you are my wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The great ship rose softly and sank again, as if breathing.
The stars stared in, unwinking. Yuki&#39;s face was deepening
in sweet content. Every shiver of the engine, every angry
hurtling of the insulted waters, thrust them consciously nearer
to Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">Roughening waves, toward the night of the fourth day,
indicated, according to the Captain, approach to the Hawaiian
Islands. He added, &quot;If any one is keen enough on it to get
up at daybreak, he will see the first outlying peaks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd, in a passion of romantic interest that was part of the
whole marvellous epic, climbed to the deck before dawn. The
stars, he fancied, looked coldly upon him, as if they resented
his presence at their coming defeat. He leaned far over,
watching waves that lapped the sides of the ship in a strange
rhythm. Under the brightening day he stared across an ocean
apparently as eternal and infinite as space, that stretched, he
knew, north and south beyond him, twelve thousand miles
of unbroken liquid desert from pole to pole. And yet through
the centuries, this perilous waste had been crossed from oasis
to island oasis by the frail canoes of men;&mdash;dark Polynesian
painted savages with marvellous powers of carving and inlaying,
who had left traces of their coming from New Zealand to
Alaska, and through the Philippines to Japan. He pictured
the advent of that first dusky Ulysses who, in feathered armor
and a Greek helmet carved from a cinnamon-tree, had here,
ages before, terminated his thousand-mile wanderings from a
forgotten South. All this had now become a new world for
Todd&#39;s own light-haired Saxon race to fall heir to, stepping-stones
in its inevitable stride to the teeming coasts of Asia.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, too, in such excitement that she could barely stop to
dress, had been staring out of the port-hole of her stateroom
since an early hour. If one of the great birds swooping incessantly
along the sides of the ship had paused to look, he
would have seen a small face, white as himself, fitted into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
round brass frame. She was there before dawn had quickened
under the sea. The mystery and the first unspeakable shiver
of a newly created day had been hers. &quot;&#39;And God moved
upon the face of the waters,&#39;&quot; whispered reverent Oriental
lips. She saw the first dark triangle of land glide toward
her through the thinning darkness,&mdash;the shimmer of rose
and green on half-veiled slopes, the gradual lighting up of
tapering peaks,&mdash;and then, the full orchestration of the
risen sun.</p>

<p class="indent">She reached the deck to find not only Mr. Todd, but the
greater number of the passengers, assembled to watch the
gorgeous spectacle from the entrance of Honolulu Bay. Night
had rolled up from the sleepy town, and surged in great sails
of pearl-tinted cloud up dark blue-green gullies of the hills.
Red scars of volcanic slopes burned through the morning,
whole peaks seemed incandescent, and terraced gardens, cleared
from lower mists, stood outlined in reflected orange light.</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments more, and the iridescent pageant vanished.
Down on the shore, rude wharves and freight-sheds and cheap,
new-painted boat-houses stared out impertinently. Back of
the harbor front the little town nestled prettily enough in its
setting of tropic greens, and half-way up the volcanic cliffs
patches of tilled fields or clumps of forest-trees relieved the
sandy wastes. At intervals a tall white house among its palms
shone out like a child&#39;s block, half imbedded in moss.</p>

<p class="indent">As the ship touched the dock, and the company broke up
to watch the native boys diving for coppers, Mrs. Todd
gathered her clan together for a holiday on shore. Yuki had
decided to wear a white American gown. Gwendolen also
was in white, like a great lily. Dodge showed up in spotless
duck and a pith helmet; Pierre wore immaculate flannels;
while Mrs. Todd, in the stiffest of skirts, the thinnest of
lawn waists, and a white linen Alpine hat a trifle too small,
looked unfortunately like a perfume bottle with a white
leather top.</p>

<p class="indent">They walked in radiant single-file down the gangway, the
faces of all three women changing to sudden blankness at the
appalling rigidity of earth, after recent days on a swaying
deck. &quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#39;t believe I can walk at all, just yet,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
said Mrs. Todd, and reached out for her natural protector.
In an instant Dodge had whistled up two cabriolets driven by
sleepy-eyed Kanakas in California hats. At the market, a
low Spanish-looking edifice with no walls, Mrs. Todd insisted
upon getting out. Some one on the ship had told her to be
sure to see the market; and this the conscientious traveller
intended to do, though the very peaks above them seemed to
rock and leap with subconscious friskiness. Here thronged a
mingled race, both buyers and sellers,&mdash;English, Japanese,
Chinese, Hawaiians, and Yankees. All the vegetable stands
were owned by Chinese, all the fruit by Kanakas. Dodge insisted
on the fact as eloquent of racial tendencies. In this
magic climate the growth of vegetables is accompanied by an
even more fervid growth of weeds, and so requires patient
vigilance. Fruit, on the other hand, cultivates itself. &quot;All the
lordly Hawaiian has to do,&quot; said Dodge, &quot;is to stand or sit under
the tree, and let it fall into his lap.&quot; Gwendolen took the
value from this last remark by indicating a heap of horny
&quot;jackfruit,&quot;&mdash;a thing the shape and size of a watermelon,
which grows out of the trunk, apparently, of live oaks, and
asking, scornfully, how much Kanaka would be left when
one of those had fallen.</p>

<p class="indent">The fish dealers&#39; department gleamed with iridescent color.
Shrimps and crabs seemed fashioned in Favrille glass. Lobsters
wore polka-dots of blue. None of these crustacea had
claws, but whether deprived of them by man or nature was
never ascertained.</p>

<p class="indent">As they drove up the narrow avenues, the unique mixture of
the population became more apparent. Chinese evidently
formed the inferior caste of laborer, content with a daily wage.
Cleverer Japanese bustled about newly opened shops of foreign
wares, or hung out professional signs of doctor, lawyer, or
notary public. The Yankee strolled about with a half-disdainful
glance; but the lordliest was not so proud as the ragged
sons of Kamehameha, who, preëmpting shady nooks in doorways,
stared disapprovingly on the passer-by. In the grounds
of the former &quot;palace,&quot; members of a present legislature lolled
on the green, and nibbled peanuts. Pert Kanaka girls, in New
York shirt-waists and automobile veils, minced by the side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
fat mamas in Mother Hubbard gowns, generally of red, with
huge ruffles about the yoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop, Cy! Tell the man to stop. There&#39;s a druggist!
I have several things to get!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And look! next to it a book-store advertising the latest
novels,&quot; supplemented Gwendolen. &quot;Doesn&#39;t that seem a
joke? We must get some. I see souvenirs, and photographs,
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what we&#39;d better do. You women-folks get
out and shop. Le Beau will stick to Yuki, I guess; while
Dodge and I take this carriage around to the post-office,&mdash;I&#39;ve
heard there was one,&mdash;and try to find out the latest
news about the war,&quot; cried Mr. Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">In a quarter of an hour they were back, breathless. &quot;War&#39;s
coming, and it&#39;s coming soon!&quot; panted the senator.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s the ticket. Japan has called, and Russia must
show her hand or crawfish,&quot; supplemented Dodge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But not really, really&mdash;yet <i>begun</i>?&quot; whispered Yuki, who
had turned very pale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What <i>does</i> the young man mean?&quot; asked Mrs. Todd, anxiously,
of her spouse. &quot;I can&#39;t believe in irresponsible war
rumors. I <i>sha&#39;n&#39;t</i> believe them. Why, only two days before
we left Washington, Prince Breakitoff assured me solemnly
that the difficulty would never be allowed to reach the point of
war.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Todd winked toward his secretary. &quot;Well,&quot; he said
solemnly, &quot;Prince Breakitoff ought to know more about the
facts of the case than a Hawaiian newspaper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He certainly <i>ought</i> to,&quot; said Dodge, ambiguously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;War! Who dares to hint of war?&quot; cried Pierre. &quot;Look
at this sky above us, and that tangle of sun and shower dragging
rainbow echoes across a peacock-colored bay! Who
could be found to fight on such an earth? Do you not say so,
too, my Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki started slightly, and hesitated, as if to form her words.
Before she could speak, Dodge had interrupted: &quot;As long as
we are so close, would you-all mind walking one more block
on foot? The prettiest sight in the town is just to the left of
that jutting brick wall down there.&quot; He pointed. Mrs. Todd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
was off. Yuki slipped in close to Gwendolen, and clung to her
friend&#39;s arm. She did not want to think, just now, of war.
Past new American shops they went, ice-cream &quot;parlors,&quot;
dry-goods displays of underwear,&mdash;&quot;marked down&quot; sales, of
course,&mdash;and windows of ready-made gowns on insipid waxen
dummies. Dodge had taken a few feet in advance. He now
turned sharply, facing into a narrow street, one of the old
native thoroughfares, bordered by walls of brick and stone
where moss spread and dampness oozed. On an absurdly
narrow pavement squatted a row of fat and shapeless beings,
presumably women, half buried in wreaths and coils of strange
flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Behold the far-famed lei sellers of Hawaii!&quot; announced
Dodge, with an histrionic gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see no hens,&quot; said Mrs. Todd, through raised lorgnettes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These are a different brand of lei,&quot; explained Dodge, without
a smile; &quot;flower-wreaths that are to the hat of the
Hawaiian dandy what an orchid or a gardenia is to the button-hole
of a Fifth Avenue sport.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sellers had sprung instantly into kneeling postures, all
as if pulled by a single wire. Brown arms went forth, like
those of crabs, flower hung. &quot;Lei, lei, Honolulu lei! Prettie
flower! Prettie ladees! Dollar&mdash;Fufty cents! Here,
ladee, prettie lei, twunty-fi&#39; cents!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Offer a quarter for three, and see them hustle,&quot; said
Dodge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what visions of beauty!&quot; breathed Gwendolen, and
flung down silver coin at random. &quot;See, ropes of carnations!
Pink oleanders threaded into regular cables! And oh, the
lovely yellow things,&mdash;my color,&mdash;golden acacias, I believe.
I shall loop myself like an East Indian idol in these fragrant
necklaces. And what are those purple things, and those?
Why, why, I don&#39;t know the others at all. I thought I was
friends with every flower. They smell like heaven!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frangipani, ylang-ylang, stephanotis, plumaria, acacia,&quot;
rattled Dodge, in the tone and manner of a professional guide.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a delightful courier you would make, Mr. Dodge!&quot;
cried saucy Gwendolen. &quot;I think I&#39;ll bespeak your services,
now, for my wedding journey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m jolly well apt to be along on that particular trip, you
know,&quot; retorted the young man, with such cool assurance that
all laughed&mdash;except Mrs. Todd. That good lady had begun
to view, with some apprehension, the over-confident tactics
of the attaché. Gwendolen, after an unsuccessful attempt to
stare him &quot;down,&quot; bent flushed cheeks and laughing eyes to
the flowers. &quot;We must all wear <i>lei</i>, of course,&quot; she cried, a
trifle unsteadily. &quot;It&#39;s positively the only thing to do on
such a day! Yuki, pink carnations will be ravishing on
your little white sailor-hat, and also, by a happy coincidence,
on Pierre&#39;s new Panama. Dad, you and mother must have
this divine stephanotis, mixed with a little smilax, for a green
old age. Just think of buying strung stephanotis by the
yard! And, Mr. Dodge,&mdash;last and not least, Mr. T. Caraway
Dodge!&mdash;&quot; Mockingly she caught up a string of magenta-colored
&quot;bachelor buttons,&quot; and would have offered them
with a curtsey; but already Dodge had carefully wound his
helmet in coils of acacia flowers until it had become, in shape
and size, an old-fashioned beehive made of gold.</p>

<p class="indent">This time she presented her back squarely. The others
withheld laughter until they should have read the expression
on the chaperon&#39;s face. But she, oblivious apparently of this
new bit of daring, had lorgnettes at her eyes, and was studying
carefully a closely written list,&mdash;a composite of suggestions,
made up for her by admiring ship friends. &quot;Punch
Bowl Crater, The Bishop Museum, Banana Plantations,
Waki-ki Beach,&mdash;note colors on the shoals,&mdash;House where
R. L. Stevenson resided,&quot; she was murmuring, as though to
fix each in her memory. Suddenly she looked up. &quot;Cyrus,
the carriages! I doubt whether we can get them all in, but
I intend to do my best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother!&quot; began Gwendolen, in a note of protest. Yuki
was smiling, and Pierre also. As long as they were together,
nothing else mattered. The countenance of Dodge, however,
had an acrobatic fall from elation to horrified disappointment.
At sight of this, Gwendolen actually glittered mischief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, mother dear,&quot; she hastened to answer. &quot;Let
us take everything in,&mdash;even a little more, if possible. We
all need our minds improved,&mdash;and some of us our manners!&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
Dodge, darting a look into her face, found only
trustful innocence. The carriages had arrived. With great
ostentation he assisted Mrs. Todd into her place. &quot;I think I
shall be able to supply one or two interesting spots not down
on that list,&quot; he suggested, with a tentative look at the
empty cushion beside her. &quot;Claus Spreckels&#39; house, the Infirmary,
the Honolulu University with miles of hedges made
up of volcanic stone overgrown with night-blooming cereus&mdash;you
mustn&#39;t miss that!&quot; Dodge&#39;s eyes and his smile
were frankness embalmed and irradiated. Mrs. Todd perforce
smiled in reply. &quot;Jump in,&quot; she said cordially. &quot;You&#39;re
quite a treasure in travelling, Mr. Dodge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen meekly took a rear seat by her father. As she
pressed lovingly against him, sending upward the tiniest little
teased smile of discomfiture, his face broke into merry
wrinkles. &quot;I think you&#39;ve found your match this time,
little girl,&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You just wait,&quot; nodded the oracular Gwendolen.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It is a memorable experience, analogous to nothing else
in the world, that landing, for one iridescent day, in the
Pacific&#39;s mid-ocean, throwing one&#39;s fancies and one&#39;s heart
into strange tropic scenes, and then returning at nightfall,
like tired, happy children, to the great old mother-nursery of
the ship.</p>

<p class="indent">By the next morning, not even a cloud on that horizon from
which we are fleeing betrays the hiding-place of land. At
once the island takes proper place as a vision, a mirage of
the imagination, where souls of certain privileged beings
have met, and are henceforth bound in a unity of mystic comradeship.
After such a day, Pacific passengers turn to one
another with kindlier smiles, the whole ship changes into one
heaving picnic party, old Time himself joins in the holiday,
and personal dislikes, brought on board, are flung to the waves.
That most of these animosities, like the Biblical bread, return
to the owners after not so many days, need not affect
present hilarity.</p>

<p class="indent">As may be supposed, Gwendolen and her closest attendant,
Dodge, were small whirling centres in the round of gay diversions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
The conventional deck-games were started, and a terminating
three days of competitive skill, with prizes bought
at Honolulu and marked with the name of the ship and date
of voyage, duly announced. Revelry was to culminate in a
grand &quot;fancy dress ball,&quot; the night before landing, a prize
being given to the costumer who showed most skill in fashioning
his or her attire from things procurable on board ship,
and in carrying out the character assumed. In order to
waste no more time upon this function, it may be stated that
Mr. T. Caraway Dodge as &quot;Dandy Jim,&quot;&mdash;with painted purple
rings on a dress shirt and a &quot;claw-hammer&quot; coat a size too
small, ebony countenance, lips like two flaming sausages caught
loosely at the ends, and a wig fashioned from the hair of his
bunk mattress,&mdash;sang and cake-walked himself straight to
the prize, while defeated contestants rent night with applause
and acclamation.</p>

<p class="indent">From the smoking-room an incessant clinking, as of fairy
castanets, fretted the ears of feminine curiosity. Mr. Todd
explained that it was merely the sound of checkers and chessmen
rattling to the shiver of the ship&#39;s screw.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun came up each morning, small and round, like a
mandarin orange; expanded himself into a blinding deity; and
at evening went down again, a blood-red orange, into the sea.
The days he brought were long and golden, but not long enough
for all the practising of bull-board, quoits, shuffle-board, and
deck tennis. Each morning, after breakfast, certain acrobatic
performances, free of charge, were held. Bag-punching was
the children&#39;s favorite. One could count on an audience
there, of upturned faces, wide-eyed and solemn with admiration.
Some of the passengers saw fit to attach pedometers,
and walk an incredible number of miles each day.</p>

<p class="indent">In the evening, Mrs. Todd and bridge whist reigned supreme.
The Captain proved to be a player; so, to his present
anguish, was Dodge. Gwendolen took an elfish delight in
luring this young man to a table, under pretence of desiring to
be his partner, and then, at the last moment, slipping in a
foreordained substitute; after which she sped off, carolling,
to a moonlit deck. Once there, the fuming and impotent
Dodge recognized only too clearly what she would do. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
least a dozen new acquaintances of the other sex had been
made thus far by Gwendolen. It was her wont to dispense
Emersonian philosophy and delicately portioned encouragement
to those who were fortunate enough to secure her companionship.
There was a young Dutch merchant on his way
to coffee plantations in Java, very blond and fierce as to mustachios,
and mild in the eyes. A Chicago representative, on
his way to sell to Eastern potentates his particular make of
automobile, had already needed, to quote Gwendolen&#39;s own,
words, &quot;a slight slackening of speed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An English &quot;leftenant&quot; returning to South Africa, carried
with him his own marvellous outfit for the making of afternoon
tea, backed by a mammoth English plum-cake in a tin
box. He was one to be propitiated, especially toward eight
bells on an afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent">An Austrian viscount posed as the slayer of jungle beasts.
&quot;Beeg gam,&quot; he called them. He doted upon seeing this
timid and shrinking maid cower beneath the bloody wonder of
his yarns. No one before had inspired such thrilling denouements
as Mees Todd. He recognized her at once for his
affinity, and on the night before landing condescended to tell
her so. The shock was rude, but he deserved what he got.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre and Yuki joined in these several amusements and
occupations during the morning and afternoon hours, both
being much petted and nattered by the ladies of the ship, as
beau ideals of young lovers. In the evenings, on the balmy
deck, they were left to themselves. Wonderful talks grew
between them,&mdash;whispers, sometimes, that the jealous wind
tore from their lips before the last word came. Yuki had not
won back the half-troth given, nor, on the other hand, had
Pierre gained more.</p>

<p class="indent">Often their talk was of impersonal things. The young man
delighted to draw from Yuki quaint phrases of comment, and
hints of the Oriental imagery with which her fancy thrilled.
She told him the story of the stars, Vega and Aquilla, called in
her land the Herd-Boy and the Weaver-Girl; how, for some
fault, committed before this little earth was made, they could
cross the milky stream of Heaven, and meet, but one night in
a year.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
When he pointed to a flock of flying fish skimming in a blue
and silver phantasy above a turquoise floor, she called them
the souls of birds that had flown too far from land, and been
drowned at sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Within a few days of landing, a certain change, perceptible,
it may be, only to the most sensitive, crept into the elements
of air and water, and tinged even the up-piling clouds. Yuki
stared now, for long moments, in silence, toward that hidden
bank of the West. Pierre felt a change in her; but when he
questioned, she laughed a little nervously, and said it was
merely the outer edge of Nippon&#39;s &quot;aura.&quot; Undoubtedly she
was restless, a little moody, a trifle excited, and touched, at
times, with brooding thoughts. She dreaded the opening with
Pierre of topics which, all along, she had tried to avoid. Yet
now, so close to home, she must make stronger efforts to
free herself.</p>

<p class="indent">One afternoon at sundown, when the great reverberating
&quot;dressing gong&quot; had sent most of the ladies below-stairs,
Pierre, hurrying up to Yuki, where, for a half-hour past she
had sat alone in a far corner of the deck looking outward,
leaned and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This promises to be the most wonderful sunset of all. It
may be our last. The Captain has just told me that, with
good luck, we sight land to-morrow. Do you dare come out
with me to the very prow of the ship?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I dares,&quot; smiled Yuki, rising instantly. &quot;I have
wished often to go to that small, lonely point of ship.&quot; As
they started, he caught up a discarded wrap. &quot;The wind is
fresher there,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few moments she remarked, in a slightly embarrassed
tone, &quot;That will be a very good place to say&mdash;something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre made no reply. He also had been thinking of it as
an excellent place in which to say&mdash;something.</p>

<p class="indent">Together, in silence, they made way over the aerial bridge
that connects the triangular front deck with the main one;
moving over the heads of steerage passengers, principally
Chinese, who squatted in the sunken square to breathe in what
they could of the cool, evening breeze. The sun was setting,&mdash;&quot;a
polished copper gong like that ship one which makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
much noise,&quot; said Yuki. It sank, clear-cut and very round,
just at that point of the horizon where Nippon might be
thought to lie.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre placed the girl in the small angle at the peak. An
arm was stretched behind her, and a hand clung to the rail,
to protect them both. He leaned forward until his cheek
almost pressed against her own. The soft incessant rush of
wind blew her heavy hair back from a forehead spiritually
pure and white. Her long, delicately modelled nose and
small curved chin made a cameo against the blue-gray stone
of dusk. Pierre, watching her intently, saw the last red ray
of the sun quiver on her lips. The little hands were raised,
as if unconsciously, and clapped thrice, very softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you praying to your sun-god, little Christian Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, indeed,&quot; said Yuki, quickly. &quot;It is not prayer as
we Christians call praying; it is only just our Japanese way
of thanking Sun San for his great beauty, and the much good
he does flowers, and people, and everything. In Japan we
often thanks things just for being beautiful.&quot; She smiled
up confidingly into his face. Her little hands, now lowered,
flecked the rail like bits of white foam.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I should pray to you, my darling, for in all this
world never was anything more beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made no effort to answer this, not even by her usual
small, deprecating smile and shake of the head. The necessity
of what she was to say, blotted from those first moments by
visual beauty, now came heavily back to her. She steadied
herself, turning slightly to see his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pierre, trust me a little more. Give back that promise,&mdash;the
promise you won from my weakness. It holds me from
my path like a thorn. Our cause will be better without it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre started, and looked at the girl incredulously. &quot;Have
you let me lead you here deliberately to ask me such a
thing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not admit anger to your thought, dear Pierre,&quot; she
pleaded. &quot;I must have said some time. I should have said
to you long before this; but we have been so&mdash;happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pierre, doggedly. &quot;We have been happy;
and I intend that we shall be happier still. That promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
is all I have to hold you by. I&#39;d draw it tighter if I
could.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will not understand,&mdash;you will not try to understand
me,&quot; said the girl, in a despairing voice. &quot;Such promise given
is disrespect to my parents, particularly to my father. If you
do not release, I must tell to him, of course. It will be bad
for you and me. Can you not trust me? Oh, Pierre, for
love&#39;s sake, release&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Release you!&quot; he interrupted wildly. &quot;This is my answer.
It is for love&#39;s sake that I hold you, and will hold.&quot; He seized
her in his arms, and held her with cruel strength. The night
had come in fast. He did not care that the watchman by the
tall, straight mast might see them. No one could hear the
wind-driven, hurrying words. &quot;This is my answer. I hold
thus all you have given,&mdash;and more. You are sincere, I
believe, but mistaken. A weak yielding on my part would
make your parents, and perhaps yourself, despise me. I keep
what I have, I say, and I demand still more. You must be
true to me, no matter what occurs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pierre, Pierre, you trample on your own hope, though you
will not see it! To release me generously is your own best
way!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are the self-deceived,&quot; cried Pierre. &quot;Pledge yourself
irrevocably. Then only are we strong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the western sky an orange strip of day remained. A
single bird, black against the glow, flew screaming across it,
beating curved wings in the wind. &quot;He will not see at all,&quot;
whispered Yuki, as if to the bird.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dearest, you cannot know in your calm, innocent
heart the scourge of a love like mine! I hunger for you, I
thirst! Sobbing, I dream of you, and I wake to new tears
that you are still so far away. In pity, in mere mercy to
human suffering, say that no other man shall marry you. Say
this much at least, that if prejudice and war hold us apart
awhile, you will be true to me until we can seek some new
road to happiness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do I not know,&mdash;do I not know?&quot; she shivered, in answer
to the first part of his speech. &quot;Every day my heart is torn
to small pieces, all of different size and shape. I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
understand how in sleep they come together once more. You
are not lonely in that human suffering.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you love me!&quot; cried the man. &quot;And on this voyage
you love me as you had not done before! Is it not true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true,&quot; sobbed Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mine is not love,&quot; said Pierre, again holding her fast;
&quot;it is hell,&mdash;a raging hell of ecstasies! Oh, kiss me, Yuki;
give me your lips before I die of joy! Now swear,&mdash;swear,&mdash;that
no word but my own,&mdash;no circumstance but death,
can loose you from me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You torture like the old monks,&quot; she panted. &quot;Oh, do
not make me say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I command you, Yuki,&quot; he persisted, feeling new strength
as she faltered. &quot;It is my right. We belong to each other.
Promise,&mdash;promise,&mdash;promise,&mdash;nothing but death or my
word to loose you!&quot; He kissed her again and again, like a
madman, pressing his lips down upon hers, catching her hands
to kiss, devouring her eyes, cheeks, forehead, hair; while
the girl, beaten down by the whirlwind, made no effort to
resist.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre took the long white ivory pin from her hair, and
split it, thrusting the smaller portion into his coat, and returning
that, with the ornament still attached, to her hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I take this pledge, Yuki,&quot; he cried. &quot;You have told me
that it binds to the death a Japanese lover. We are bound.
I hold you by a tangible bond. The next shall be a small,
bright circle on this little hand. Give me the promise, Yuki,&mdash;no
need to struggle now. Give it me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kwannon protect me,&quot; gasped the girl; &quot;I promise!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden vacuum fell. Pierre&#39;s breath was hard to recapture.
He thought that Yuki had fainted, for her trembling
had stopped. He shook one shoulder and bent down to gaze
into her set, white face. Her eyes were wide open, and held
two stars. She moved her lips now, and leaned far outward,
gazing intently, as if watching the flight of an unseen
thing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki, Yuki, what is it,&mdash;what do you see?&quot; he cried, in
terror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My soul! I think a small soul fled!&quot; All at once she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
collapsed into unconsciousness. As Pierre lifted her, he
shook springing tears away, and bit his quivering lips as he
muttered,&mdash;&quot;I feel as if I tortured a child; but she does
not realize our perils. Her fast promise is our only hope.
Thank God that I could win it!&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> nearness of land as yet invisible gave to the ship next
morning that access of animation noted in the approach to
Hawaii, and in the day-distant interval from the Golden
Gate.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the passengers, scorning to notice a few rough
waves, buzzed or moved in groups about the deck. Games
were put away. Marine glasses and kodaks came into vogue.
Gwendolen&#39;s bright eyes, with a pair equally alert and bright
beside them, strained vision for the first land. The increase
of motion, however slight, served to excuse Yuki&#39;s absence.
Two persons only assigned a different reason,&mdash;her roommate,
Gwendolen, and her fiancé, Pierre Le Beau.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre had not breakfasted in the salon,&mdash;a fact noted by
Gwendolen. He came to the upper deck very late, and lacked
his usual eager look. Gwendolen saw him instantly. Making
some excuse to the group about her, she went to him,
saying in her direct, disconcerting way,&mdash;&quot;What have you
done to my Yuki-ko? She did not sleep all night, and I am
sure she was crying! To cry is an unknown thing for
Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre met her indignation with pathetic sweetness. He
smiled. It was difficult to be harsh with Pierre. He looked
past her to the shining water. &quot;If Yuki did not speak of her
feeling, should I, even though I knew?&quot; he asked, with the
extreme of gentleness.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen flushed under the implied rebuke. Her purpose,
however, was not turned aside. &quot;Yuki is a person
whose confidence or whose love should not be forced. From
what I know of you both, I believe you coaxed and persuaded
her, last night, into some new pledge that her own
heart shrank from giving. If this is true, allow me to tell
you that you have made a fatal error, Pierre Marie Le Beau.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Pierre wheeled to the sea. It was as well that she could
not see his face. No longer gentle, it flared into a cruel
anger. His sole answer was the slightest, most exasperating
of shrugs.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen saw these signs of irritation, and cried to herself,
&quot;Halt.&quot; With a laugh that was quite successful for its
kind she exclaimed, &quot;Come, Pierre, we must not quarrel just
because we both love Yuki. I know I seem rude, but I
became Yuki&#39;s champion at school, and the habit clings.
Forgive me for Yuki&#39;s sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took the slim, outstretched hand and kissed it, but
allowed himself no further words. The girl felt baffled and
uncomfortable. She recalled a saying of her father&#39;s, &quot;Free
speech is a luxury possible only to those whose opinions mean
nothing.&quot; She felt herself herded with that undesirable
class.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I must get back to them,&quot; she cried, nodding in the
direction of the group lately deserted. &quot;I promised them
I&#39;d come back at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is Yuki indisposed this morning?&quot; asked Pierre. &quot;May
I not expect her on deck?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His tone was condescending. Gwendolen writhed under it.
&quot;She&#39;ll be up in half an hour, I guess,&quot; she gave answer, and
hurried away, rubbing the back of her hand against her dress
as she went.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge made room for her at the rail. She wedged herself
in place with a sigh of content. &quot;Look hard, now!&quot; whispered
her companion. &quot;The others haven&#39;t a hint. Yes,
right out there in front, <i>hard</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen stared obediently. Surely there was something
strange, prophetic on that far blue rim. &quot;Is it&mdash;oh, can it
be&mdash;that little roughened thread in the warp and woof of
blue&mdash;is it&mdash;Japan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rumor spun about the ship,&mdash;was caught up in whispers,&mdash;tangled,&mdash;tossed
on to the next group. &quot;Japan,&mdash;some
one has seen Japan!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Men, with feet very much apart, steadied themselves behind
beetle-like marine glasses. &quot;By Jove, there she is!&quot; The
waves outside fawned and bounded in answering excitement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
Dolphins leaped high in air. A whole fleet of &quot;Portuguese
men-o&#39;-war&quot; rose to the surface and scurried on before them
as if leading a swifter way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall simply pass away with ecstasy!&quot; cried Gwendolen.
&quot;Oh, why doesn&#39;t Yuki come? Look, Mr. Dodge; I believe
I see sails&mdash;away off there, between us and the phantom
land!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doubtless a squad of detached fishing-smacks,&quot; said Dodge,
with that courier-like precision which seemed part of him on
land or in sight of land.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! oh! oh!&quot; shrieked she, jumping up and down like
a child. &quot;We are rushing straight for one. It has a square
sail laced across the slits with white shoestrings. Oh, we are
going to run it down!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My <i>dear</i>!&quot; remonstrated Mrs. Todd at the girl&#39;s impetuous
manner. Her own kindly face beamed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not on your life,&quot; said Dodge the Oracle. &quot;They know
how to look out for number one. You just watch &#39;em.&quot; Even
as he spoke the small skiff darted impudently into the very
shadow of their looming bulk, and sped off again like a
swallow. Two impassive brown faces lifted for an instant
from the great shining heap of bonito in the bottom of the
boat, and were lowered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much floral-anchor business about those two, eh,
Captain?&quot; asked Mr. Todd, genially, of that magnate, as he
strolled toward them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I admit the coast population to be amphibious,&quot; laughed
the Captain, &quot;but you can&#39;t make admirals out of fishermen.
Miss Gwendolen, it will soon be time to look for Few-ji.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; cried Gwendolen again. She was made up, this
morning, of wind-tossed golden hair and expletives. &quot;Certainly
no one ever saw it, truly, at such a distance!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have,&quot; boasted Dodge. &quot;On a clear day I&#39;ve seen the
thing a hundred miles off, when it looked like a little white
tee on a blue golf links, don&#39;t you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Golf links!&quot; echoed Gwendolen. &quot;What an unworthy
simile!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not links?&mdash;first-class thing, a good links! Don&#39;t
you play, Miss Todd?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
&quot;No,&quot; answered Gwendolen, truthfully, &quot;I don&#39;t play, but
I like to pose, the costumes are so utterly fetching; and I
dote on standing with my driver behind me, like girls in
illustrated picture papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to search the shimmering horizon for the vision
it would not yield. &quot;Oh, where is that mountain! I wish
Yuki would come. It might appear directly for Yuki-ko.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here is Yuki,&quot; said the low, strange voice that could have
belonged to no other.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen seized her. &quot;Good-morning, Miss Onda,&quot;
smiled Dodge. &quot;Now we are all fit. Kindly invoke your
enchanted summit to our wondering gaze. I have been told
that it was bad luck to land after a long journey without a
glimpse of Fuji-san.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think the bad luck for only Nipponese,&quot; said Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the good luck too, I presume, if it turns that way?
How inhospitable!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I think so. The good luck and the bad luck,&quot; was
Yuki&#39;s serious reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, strolling at the rear end of the passenger deck, must
have seen Yuki. He made no sign, however, and continued
to stroll alone, smoking cigarettes, with a pleasant look or
reply for any chance acquaintance, but a mind evidently
involved in its own problems.</p>

<p class="indent">Neither of the girls saw him. They leaned together now
upon the rail. Gwendolen had an arm about her friend. Together
they stared out toward the land. Dodge had been
called away. Mr. and Mrs. Todd were seated, the former
carefully counting out bills for various &quot;tips&quot; soon to be
distributed. The schoolmates were practically alone.</p>

<p class="indent">The land showed clearly now its hill and rock formation.
Layer after layer, set upright from the sea, vanished into
hazy distance. Promontory after promontory tapered down
at the far point to a surf-beaten line of rocks. Farther peaks
rose in tones of blue,&mdash;some thin as water, others rich and
dark, like great gentians. On the nearer hills, forests and
shaven spots of green appeared. The water around them
shone and stirred with sails, the square-laced sails of junks.
Bronze-colored boatmen, scantily clad, stood on the swaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
edge of a boat and shaded their eyes to peer upward at the
strange, white-faced &quot;seiyo-jin.&quot; Among the junks, sailless
sampan, propelled by one crooked oar, tumbled like queer sea-beetles
with a single jointed leg.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendolen,&quot; said Yuki, in a very low voice, &quot;do you see
a long, green patch, like moss, over on that brown slope?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I was thinking it looked like curled parsley.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is really a forest,&mdash;quite a big little forest,&mdash;made
of sugi, and camphor, and camellia trees. Listen; I thought
then that I heard the deep sound of a bell!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hear nothing but water and the wind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was the temple bell,&quot; insisted Yuki. &quot;And now, dear,
look more close. Do you not see, right on the edge of
beach, a small red something?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes; there is a little square of red like the framework
of a door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is torii,&mdash;red torii, or sacred gate; and beyond that
gate are many, many stone steps leading up to the temple.
Ah! such steps as those,&mdash;so quiet, so deep, so still! They
lead the heart up before ever the clumsy feet have climbed.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A little steam launch, bearing the flag of the rising sun,
came puffing and squealing toward them. The ship&#39;s steps
were lowered. Grave, correct Japanese officers took possession.
Their news was astounding. War&#39;s breath already
heated the land. The Japanese minister at St. Petersburg
even then made preparation for instant departure, and his
Russian colleague in Yedo did the same. The severance of
diplomatic relations between the countries meant, of course,
no less than a declaration of war.</p>

<p class="indent">From the moment of hearing this, neither Mr. Todd nor his
secretary had a thought for anything besides,&mdash;no, not even
for pretty Gwendolen, who, for a while, sulked alone, then,
seeing it useless, sought consolation in engaging herself to all
the unmarried male passengers, one after the other, and most
of the ship&#39;s officers, irrespective of connubial ties.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre and Yuki had met, neither looking with entire
frankness into the eyes of the other. To Yuki the promise
given meant a haircloth shirt beneath her robe of gladness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
a stone dragging her back from flight. To Pierre it was,
in all sincerity, their one substantial pledge of future happiness.
He was the man. It was for him to judge, not
Yuki; and he believed the very reluctance with which she
gave the word, a proof of its necessity. It was characteristic
of both that no reference was made to the subject most vital
in their thoughts. Yuki watched with apparent composure
the slow approach to Yokohama Bay, Awa&#39;s cone-shaped
masses, and the long, green northern coast fading into eastern
haze. Fuji had not shone for them,&mdash;in spite of a cloudless
day. &quot;It sometimes went away like that,&quot; Yuki had assured
the disappointed ones. &quot;Children thought that it went visiting
to the gardens of the gods.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The harbor channel was free. The ship went slowly,
majestically, like a great deliberate swan, sheer to the stone
steps of the wharf. Yuki&#39;s reserve faltered. &quot;My people,&mdash;oh,
my dear people! I think I see their faces in that waiting
crowd!&quot; they heard her whisper. She stretched out her
arms. A sob choked in her throat. Four years,&mdash;four long,
long years, and yet how familiar the look of her native land!
The little wind-bent pines along the stone dyke had not
changed a leaf. Those long, waiting rows of empty jinrikishas
might hold one that had been waiting for her through an
hour of shopping in the foreign stores of Yokohama. And,
oh, the dear welcoming friends there on the steps!</p>

<p class="indent">Their party was the first to cross the platform of the
lowered flight of stairs. Yuki touched the first stone step,
and gazed eagerly above her. Yes, that was her mother, that
gentlest, sweetest, most beautiful face among them all! Behind
her stood Onda Tetsujo, Yuki&#39;s father, with his plain
blue robes, and gray, nobly poised head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother! Okkasan,&mdash;Shibaraku!&quot; (How long the absence!)
cried the girl, with a broken note of rapture in her voice.
Bounding up the steps, she clasped and was clasped again by
the slender gray figure. Tetsujo drew back, a fleeting look
of perplexity in his face. He had not recognized Yuki, thus
seen, for the first time, in her perfectly adapted foreign garments;
but Iriya had known, from the moment her eyes
caught the small brown-clad figure at the rail. The mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
in her swept away, for the instant, high barriers of Japanese
etiquette. She clung to her child, fondling her, pressing trembling
lips to the soft young cheeks, and murmuring, &quot;My
baby,&mdash;my little one,&mdash;my treasure, who has come back to
me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later they had drawn apart, both with wet eyes
and quivering lips, and small, bashful side-looks of love; for
such public demonstration is practically unknown among samurai
women. Already these two were a little ashamed of it.
Tetsujo realized at last that it was his daughter, but, because
of her strange conduct, wore still an uncomprehending wrinkle
between his heavy brows.</p>

<p class="indent">The Todd party, Pierre and Mr. T. Caraway Dodge included,
came hesitatingly near. The Japanese crowd drew back, some
in distaste, some in politeness, some because their own friends
had arrived, and there was no longer a reason for staying.
Yuki, with a hand on Gwendolen&#39;s arm, began the introductions.
When it came to the two young men, she hesitated
slightly. Her father&#39;s deep, keen eyes rested on the faces
first of one, then of the other. The two names, as she hurried
them over, were practically unintelligible.</p>

<p class="indent">Kind-hearted Mrs. Todd, observing Yuki&#39;s embarrassment
and feeling that she had at least a hint as to its cause, rushed
gallantly into the breech. Her efforts centred on shrinking
Mrs. Onda. &quot;Are you really Yuki&#39;s mother?&quot; she demanded
in a loud, playful voice. &quot;You look to me like her sister. I
wouldn&#39;t believe, unless I were told, that you had more than
five years between you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki threw a glance of gratitude toward the speaker.
&quot;Mother, Mrs. Todd says that you appear augustly young to be
indeed the daughter of a big girl like me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya flushed and bowed, looking more than ever like her
daughter. She answered in Japanese, &quot;Please honorably to
thank the lady for her compliment, but acquaint her with the
fact that I am already lamentably old. On my next birthday
I shall be thirty-nine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo, having accomplished his share of stiff bows,&mdash;not
forgetting an extra one for the new American minister,&mdash;said
to his daughter, &quot;My child, we are indeed happy to welcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
you. Now thank your good friends in my name. Suitable
presents shall be sent them. We must depart for Yedo.&quot;
He moved one finger toward three waiting jinrikisha men
near-by, and the vehicles, like magic, stood beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, already it must be &#39;Sayonara.&#39; My father desires
me to go,&quot; said Yuki, and smiled a little tremulously from one
foreign face to another. These farewells at the end of a long
and pleasant journey are never careless things to say. &quot;Of
course I will see all&mdash;every one&mdash;very soon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki! Why, we never thought of this. You mustn&#39;t
leave us so!&quot; cried Gwendolen, in consternation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; added Pierre, with more vehemence. &quot;It isn&#39;t to
be thought of. Tell your father that we are counting on you
for the day.&quot; He stepped close to her. Yuki instinctively
shrank. The puzzled look came again to the face of Tetsujo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be careful, Pierre! Look at his face! You will make a
false move at the start,&quot; came Gwendolen&#39;s whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you expect me to stand here patiently and see her carried
away? Non! Mon Dieu, it was to have been the consecrating
day of our lives! I do not give it up. I will try
speaking myself with her father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendolen is right. Do not speak!&quot; panted Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">But Pierre was not one to relinquish bliss so easily. No
move seemed to him quite as undesirable as the one about to
take place. Facing the astonished samurai, he began a series
of bows which he fondly conceived to embody the finer points
of both French and Japanese etiquette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur Onda,&mdash;Onda San,&quot; he commenced eagerly,
&quot;Miss Yuki must not go. Ikimasen! Stay here with friends,&mdash;tomodachi.
She can go your house&mdash;afternoon. Please do
not take her now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Onda looked blankly and in silence upon the antics of the
strange creature. Not one gleam of comprehension enlivened
his fixed gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, man, let me get to him,&quot; said Dodge, thrusting himself
in front of Pierre. &quot;I&#39;ll translate what you are trying
to say, though it isn&#39;t a particle of use. Shall I go on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Merci.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Speaking slowly, in fairly good Japanese, Dodge said, &quot;We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
having hoped to enjoy the company of your daughter on this
first day of landing, I am requested to entreat your august
permission to allow her to remain. If you and your wife will
join our party also, we shall feel honored by your condescension.&quot;
&quot;Never told a bigger lie in my life!&quot; was his mental
note after this last remark.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo replied by the courtesy of a stiff bow. With no
further glance or word for the speaker, he stepped up into his
jinrikisha, and once seated, said to Yuki, &quot;Reply to the
speech of the foreigner, my child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am to go with my parents, of course,&quot; said Yuki, nervously.
&quot;I wish it. I did not know you were planning so sure
for me to remain. I must go now, at once, but will see you as
soon as I may, to-morrow, or perhaps this very afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya had bowed to the foreigners and entered her jinrikisha
immediately after Tetsujo. Yuki now climbed into the remaining
one, neither Dodge nor Pierre retaining enough self-possession
to assist her. The three coolies caught up the
shafts for starting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, stop, stop!&quot; cried Gwendolen, springing forward.
&quot;Yuki, we don&#39;t even know your Tokio address!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo gave a gesture and a &quot;cluck.&quot; The coolies sprang
into action.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ko-ishikawa, Kobinata, Shi&mdash;j&#363;&mdash;&quot; trailed off Yuki&#39;s
voice into the rattling of the streets.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The ogre! I&#39;ll catch the next train for Tokio,&quot; cried Pierre.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better stay with us and see about your baggage, Pierre,&quot;
said Mr. Todd, speaking for the first time. &quot;The girl should
go with her people, and you know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, poor boy,&quot; said Mrs. Todd, soothingly, her hand
touching his arm, &quot;I know how he has counted on seeing
the sights with Yuki.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Onda Tetsujo&#39;s spoken order had been &quot;stenshun!&quot; (station),
for so have the Japanese incorporated our familiar word. A
train was just leaving for Yedo. Three second-class tickets
were bought, and the kuruma-men overpaid and dismissed. Had
they been merely &quot;paid,&quot; a later train would have been taken.</p>

<p class="indent">The short encounter on the Yokohama pier evidently remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
in the master&#39;s mind as a most disagreeable impression.
While in no sense a stupid man, the quality of Onda&#39;s intellect
was torpid rather than alert. Things came to him slowly, and
remained long.</p>

<p class="indent">It happened that their train was a &quot;local,&quot; stopping at all
the small intermediate stations. Between Yokohama and the
next stop,&mdash;Kanagawa,&mdash;not a word was spoken. Yuki felt
bewildered, dazed, distressed. What had happened? What
was spoiling her home-coming? The promise was not all, for
here were her parents, moody and ill at ease, and they as yet
knew nothing of her pledge. Surely the few injudicious
words Pierre tried to speak should not have wrought all this.
Poor Pierre, with his hurt blue eyes and outstretched hand
of longing! Well, the American girls used to say that true
love never did run smooth. Here she gave a sigh so deep that
Iriya started. All three gazed heavily from the windows,
only half seeing the villages sweep past, and the wide, gleaming
rice-fields in their winter flood, and the long edge of
Yedo Bay set with pines, and flecked with shining sails.
The gaudy fluttering of small banners above the tea booths of
Kawasaki brought a momentary light of pleasure into the
girl&#39;s eyes. It died down as quickly. Her father&#39;s averted
face clouded her sun. Yet unconsciously the charm and the
glamour of the country was stealing back. At Omori, perhaps
the most beautiful of these suburban villages, their compartment,
being toward the rear of the train, stopped, it would
seem, in the very midst of a grove of &quot;umè&quot; flowers, just
coming into bloom. It is an old orchard, knowing many generations
of loving care. It is trimmed and tended for beauty
alone, the small sour fruit called by foreigners &quot;plums&quot; being
uneatable, and no more to the Japanese marketer than are
&quot;rose-apples&quot; to us. The trees, set close together so that tips
of branches met, were entirely leafless, and frosted over with
a delicate lichen growth. On this silver filigree of boughs
the blossoms shone, white, crimson, or pink,&mdash;translucent
gems of flowers. The odor, stealing softly to Yuki in little
throbs, smote her as with an ecstasy of remembrance. There
is no subtler necromancer than perfume. Through it the past
may be reconstructed, dead love quiver into life, and sorrow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
often more precious than joy itself, steal back like a loving
ghost.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki seemed to wake suddenly, as from a troubled sleep.
&quot;Why,&quot; she cried to herself, &quot;I am at home again! This
is Japan!&quot; She sat upright now, eager and vivid, looking
from one window to another, a new brightness in her face.
The locomotive, which had been restlessly inactive for a few
moments past, gave a long, shrill whistle, drew itself together,
and prepared for another run. Just as the wheels were turning,
a broad-faced woman of the peasant class, with a fat baby
on her back, a toddler of two years led by one hand, and a pair
of squawking geese held in the other, wriggled herself through
the turnstile and waved the shrieking fowls, as signal for the
train to stop. The gatekeeper, clutching after her, seized a
limb of the sleeping infant. Instantly a human scream added
to the clamor of the geese. Heads were thrust from car windows,&mdash;the
guard, dropping the infant&#39;s leg, seized its mother
by the sash. He chanced to be a small man, she an unusually
large woman. As a consequence she dragged him after her.
At this sight a train official, leaning as far outward as he
could for laughing, signalled the engineer to &quot;back.&quot; The
victorious one hurled herself and her living burdens into an
already overcrowded third-class car. A place was made for
her, not without many exclamations, such as &quot;Domo! Osoi!&quot;
(It is late.) &quot;Kodomo-san itai ka!&quot; (Is Mr. Baby hurt?) and
a few gruff sounds of &quot;Iya desu yo!&quot; (How disagreeable!)
The locomotive, as if conscious of a good deed, tooted more
loudly than before, and made another start.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki sparkled with delight. &quot;Think of a train official
doing that in America!&quot; she laughed aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya&#39;s answering smile was pathetic in its quickness of
response. She moved closer, pressing against Yuki&#39;s smart,
foreign shoulder. The two began to watch, like happy children,
the passing scenes.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo drew forth his pipe and smoked himself into serenity.
He listened now to what the women said. There were
other passengers, of course, but Tetsujo and his companions
had preëmpted a little corner in the rear. Iriya spoke of old
Suzumè, who was waiting so impatiently at home to see her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
charge,&mdash;of little Maru San, a distant connection of Suzumè,
who, since Yuki&#39;s departure, had been employed as maid-of-all-work
about the house. Messages of welcome from friends
and relatives were given. At the last, dropping her voice
impressively, Iriya spoke of the coming war. &quot;It is inevitable,&quot;
she said. &quot;Prince Haganè informed Tetsujo only this
morning. There can be no doubt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old scenes, the old interests, glowed anew in the girl&#39;s
heart. Really they had never left it, but, like certain writing,
illegible except in warmth, the pictures slept until the breath
of her own land awaked them. She had a strange sense of
being slowly turned back to a child. In an English fairy-book
a certain Alice could grow tall or short at will by nibbling
at a magic mushroom. There had always been magic mushrooms
in the East, long, long before that book was written,&mdash;strange
mountain growths which are the only food of the ghost
deer that attend the genii of the forest. Perhaps the little
brown sembei which she had just bought at Omori from an
insistent peddler was, in reality, a scrap of an enchanted
mushroom. Perhaps she was really turning back into the
little Japanese Yuki who had never been to America at all,
who had never known a foreign lover, or given a promise
which her reason told her to refuse. Her heart stopped beating
for an instant. She took a second bite of sembei. Again
the trouble faded. Yes, surely, it was a magic mushroom.</p>

<p class="indent">Now merry talk flowed from her smiling lips. Tetsujo
moved nearer. She called him &quot;Chichi Sama,&quot; as in baby
days, and her mother &quot;Haha San.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The train made its final stop. A torrent of blue-robed occupants
poured out from every car. The sound of wooden clogs
upon the concrete floor was like innumerable hollow shells
scraped, lip down, upon an empty box. Yuki&#39;s heart swept
in with the throng. She loved the noise, the bare station, the
hissing car, the very dust of the travellers&#39; feet. Tetsujo and
Iriya exchanged glances behind her back, and smiled. Their
eyes said, &quot;This is our dear one,&mdash;our own; not an American
changeling, but the daughter for whom we have been
yearning.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">From</span> the square, gray platform of Shimbashi station, terraced
by stone steps, hung with tiled eaves, and surrounded
by a swarming school of black jinrikishas, each with a chattering,
gesticulating, blue-clad human horse before it, one dives
at will into the iridescent life of modern Yedo. Regarded
as a city, it is little more than a collection of villages carelessly
swept together; little communities where the same
streets catch up altered names; districts with opposing trades,
antagonistic feast-days, and rival deities.</p>

<p class="indent">Tanners preëmpt an unsavory ward. Shoemakers claim
for themselves a network of small streets. The dry-goods
merchants command an avenue. Pipe-sellers, wine-merchants,
tobacconists, book-sellers, marketmen, carpenters,&mdash;each
guild tends to make a centre for itself. Perhaps, as one
consequence of this segregation, Tokio becomes the stronghold
of street peddlers. It matters little to the housewife that the
nearest market is four miles away, when sections of that
market, strapped to boyish shoulders, go crying past her gate
with the punctuality of planets. Tokio is a place where
circulating libraries literally circulate; where perambulating
oil-shops fill lamps on the patron&#39;s kitchen step or in the
glass frame at his gate, and then stop to light them; where
the tailor finishes a quilt or an overcoat on the bedroom floor,
and the hair-dresser needs no local habitation.</p>

<p class="indent">In a great semicircle crowded near the Red Gate of the
Imperial University, live and study and brawl and bluster the
students,&mdash;the future Nogis, Togos, Kurokis, Saigos, Itos, and
Oyamas of their race,&mdash;now no more than restless young
spirits in a recognized democracy of their own. Some of them
cook their own meals and patch their own faded hakama,&mdash;a
species of heroism to make death on a battlefield grow tame.
Others &quot;board&quot; in one of the long, barn-like dormitories, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
in a convenient cheap lodging-house, often three and four in
a room, at the enormous rate of fifty cents a week. Poverty
seems to them admirable, nothing whatever to be ashamed of.
The Japanese youth of the samurai class is bred to a distaste
of bodily luxury. Should one of their number show a leaning
toward soft cushions and rich food, the others ridicule him,
call him &quot;O Sharè Sama,&quot; the Tokio equivalent of &quot;Dandy,&quot;
and say that his soul grows fat.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki sped through all, breathless with the wonder of home-returning.
The three jinrikishas, Tetsujo, of course, in the
lead, went one after the other in a straight line, as though on
an invisible track. Whether in a lane four feet wide, or in an
avenue two hundred, this goose-like manner of procedure never
changed. Old familiar street-corners, familiar pines, changed
shop fronts, appealed to the girl with a sense of reality. Her
eyes filled and her heart beat faster as she caught her first
glimpse, after four years, of towering moated walls where
crawled the &quot;Dragon Pines&quot; of Iyemitsu, and of the high dark
roof now sheltering her beloved ruler.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond the palace and its moats came foreignized Yedo.
Sidewalks were here, though pedestrians still preferred the
middle of the street, turning aside good-naturedly at the
warning &quot;Hek! hek!&quot; of approaching vehicles. The streets,
conspicuously broad, were paved with concrete or with stone.
On every side rose buildings just completed, of brick and
stone, or great steel frames for other edifices. It might
have been Connecticut. The sidewalk trees, set rigidly in
hollowed concrete basins, refused to grow in Japanese fashion,
and had the poise of elms. Down centres of these streets
horse-cars jangled. Work was already started on the superseding
electric line. Yuki observed it all with conscious
pride, yet her eyes brightened with new eagerness as another
quick turn plunged them once more into the heart of feudal
Yedo.</p>

<p class="indent">The streets narrowed now to lanes, bordered on each side
with shops,&mdash;mere open booths,&mdash;flung wide to the dim rear
plaster wall. Shelves holding various wares came down sheer
to the matted floor. In the middle of the space generally sat
the master, while skirmishing about, sometimes in a gloomy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
slit of a passage to the rear, sometimes up or down stepladder-like
stairs to a crouching upper story, could be seen the small
apprentices, or kozo. The life of the Japanese kozo forms a
literature to itself; but this is not the place to begin it. These
were the narrow streets Yuki had longed for. Here were the
shop signs swinging wonderful tones of blue, dark crimson,
and white, here the great gold Chinese ideograph, sprawling
across long banners.</p>

<p class="indent">In a sort of pause between districts came a hint of suburbs,
and, winding through it, Little Pebble River. A river is
never more mysterious than when carrying its deep secrets
through a busy town. This one, the Koishikawa, dominated
the section through which it passed, giving its own name, and
establishing certain small industries of dyeing, grinding,
fishing, and boating possible nowhere else in Yedo, until the
great central artery of the Sumida is reached. Cherry-trees
joined finger-tips above the Koishikawa,&mdash;real grass crept
down its banks to trail finger in the hurrying tide.</p>

<p class="indent">It was all beautiful, all real, all familiar. From afar the
clanging of beaten metal smote the ears. Yuki remembered
that the main bridge led almost to the great gate of the
Arsenal. A moment later it came into view. Tall chimneys
pulsed black worlds of smoke, and corrugated roofs scowled
above spiked, enclosing walls. At every gate stood a sentry-box
and a soldier in blue uniform.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A mighty noise, young lady!&quot; volunteered Yuki&#39;s jinrikisha
man, in a hoarse shout. He nodded his head toward
the clamor, and then looked backward to bestow on her a confidential
grin. In the river, just in front of the arsenal, great
muddy barges were poled in and beached,&mdash;with loads of
coal and copper, iron and wood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed, it is a terrible noise,&quot; answered Yuki politely.
&quot;They must be very busy behind those walls.&quot; She sighed
heavily, but her sigh was lost in the roar of flame. The fact
that her country was at that very moment on the verge of war
with Russia, perhaps with France also,&mdash;with France,
Pierre&#39;s country!&mdash;was one of those thoughts she was trying
to keep away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They work with double force by lamp and by sun,&quot; boasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
the jinrikisha man, when they had passed the most deafening
uproar. &quot;Oh, but the Russians think us children to be
cheated and lied to! But we are preparing a lesson for the
cowardly bears,&mdash;we do not fear them! Look, O Jo San!&quot;
He chuckled loudly, and without relaxing his wonderful mechanical
trot or falling an inch behind the pace of the two
preceding kuruma, unwrapped from his wrist the inevitable
twisted tenugui, or hand towel. Keeping one end under his
palm, he let the rest stream backward, like a flag. Instead
of the usual bird, flower, or landscape etching in indigo blue,
the pattern represented a fleet of Japanese war-ships in full
engagement with the Russian navy. Under the water-level
great communities of deep-sea fish looked expectantly upward,
chop-sticks and rice-bowls in their fins. A few Russian
sailors, the first of a gorging repast, had commenced
to sink downward. The eyes of the fish were admirable in
their expression of calm certainty. Thus, before the firing
of Togo&#39;s first challenge, did the Tokio populace enjoy
prophetic visions.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond the arsenal, and its huddled concourse of working-men&#39;s
houses waiting just without the walls, the Koishikawa
took a more definite turn to the north. The Onda party, following
it, came soon to a region of green lanes and pleasant
gardens. The clamor of metal-workers died away. One knew
that birds lived in the groves. Before them the highland of
the district loomed in great dark masses, and splendid trees
of camphor and of pine soared clear against the blue. At
foot of the hill &quot;Kobinata&quot; (Little Sunshine) the three jinrikishas
halted in unison, and the three runners looked with
bovine yet inquiring faces, each upon his living burden.
The hillside road, now to be taken, rose steep and white between
bamboo hedges. Onda motioned his coolie to lower the
shafts. &quot;I am a heavy man, and with my own feet will take
the slope,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, honorable master. Indeed I say no!&quot; protested
the coolie, while making the greatest haste to obey. &quot;It is
not fitting that so exalted a person as your divine lordship
should walk. Though I break my worthless bones, I will
draw you up that precipice!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
Onda, smiling slightly, stepped into the road. Iriya would
have followed his example, but he motioned, bidding her, and
likewise Yuki, to remain seated. He paused to tuck his blue
robe a few inches higher, catching the pointed end-fold in his
belt. Iriya and her grunting bearer went by him. He remained
standing, waiting for Yuki. Their eyes met, and both
smiled. He put one powerful hand to the back of the girl&#39;s
vehicle, his face being then about on a level with hers, and,
ascending the hill beside her, used his supplementary strength
at the very steep or stony places.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl sat very slim and straight, looking eagerly about
her. &quot;Father, what is it about this land of ours that makes
all things so honorably different,&mdash;so strangely beautiful?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My daughter, it is not well to speak boastfully, even of
one&#39;s land,&quot; answered Tetsujo; but his fine, strong face did
not bear out the reproof of his words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There will be a gate now, soon to the left,&mdash;a little gate
of straw thatching, tied with loops of black hemp twine! A
pine-tree sends one stiff arm across it. On a clear day one
sees, in that green frame, the snows of Fuji-san! Oh, can I
bear it, father? I <i>must</i> speak. My heart aches already with
the loveliness. See, even the trees know that they are beautiful;
each has a soul! The trees of America have no souls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, from what I have heard and seen of the Americans,
their trees have only hardwood centres. It is what the
Americans would prefer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not all, not all,&quot; protested Yuki. &quot;I have a friend, that
blonde girl on the hatoba (wharf),&mdash;I have other friends who
understand us strangely. I think in a previous life they must
have been Japanese.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah! It is but poor respect you pay our country,&quot;
answered Tetsujo, half-teasingly. &quot;Ah,&quot; he cried, catching
her arm, &quot;the little gate, my child,&mdash;the pine-tree.&quot; Yuki&#39;s
coolie had stopped without bidding. His face, too, wore the
smile of one who loves and understands. The little gate rose
straight and square in its deep gold color of old straw, the
black knots made fantastic decoration along the ridge, the
pine-tree stretched an arm of everlasting green, and over
the straight line of the leaves, far, far out to the West, hung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
the frail cone of Fuji, like a silver bowl inverted. Yuki did
not try to speak. Her father and the coolie feasted also in
silence. In a few moments the little procession, still wordless,
began again the steep ascent.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Tetsujo&#39;s eyes went to the pebbled ground. His next
remark seemed at first incongruous. &quot;Did you see the
belching of black smoke, my Yuki, and did you hear the
clashing of scourged steel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, father, and the smoke creeps after us like an evil
spirit, even to the foot of Little Sunshine Hill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nippon is soon to enter upon mortal struggle with a great
and merciless foe. All arts of war and treachery will be used
against us. We may not survive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, it must not come,&mdash;the gods must divert it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Every samurai will give his life. Every child and woman
of his race will lie, self-slain, in blood, before the yielding.
And yet defeat may be decreed. To be blind is to be weak.
We must face unflinchingly the ultimate horror.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old gods must protect us!&quot; cried the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a Christian. The Christian gods will be invoked
to aid our enemies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, father, you hurt me! When I wished to become a
Christian, like the other girls, I wrote you many letters,&mdash;you
did not oppose it then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither do I oppose it now,&quot; said Tetsujo. &quot;In things
of religious faith each soul should seek an individual path.
Because of your intelligence I allowed you to decide. But in
patriotism,&mdash;in loyalty to your native land,&mdash;I still have
responsibility. Ah, you are my one child, and most dearly
beloved; but if ever I should see in you one taint of selfish
swerving,&mdash;if I should suspect that through the foreign
education the sinews of your love were weak&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki stopped him by a gesture. Her head was proudly
lifted. Her eyes gleamed, and her thin nostrils shook,&mdash;&quot;Such
thoughts as these are not to be spoken between a samurai and
his child. My very heart is knit of the fibres of that word
&#39;Nippon.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are certain, Yuki?&quot; Tetsujo&#39;s question and his eyes
dug deep.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
Yuki hesitated less than a fraction of thought. &quot;I am certain,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">A silence rose between them. Yuki&#39;s bright joyousness felt
a drifting cloud. What did her father mean? Had Prince
Haganè spoken ill of her? The promise to Pierre gnawed
like a hungry worm. She fought anew the phantoms of love
and approaching war. The two laden jinrikisha coolies tugged
on with ostentatious groans. The hand towels now came into
requisition for the mopping of streaming brows. The road
began to curve into a level space, from which hedge-bordered
lanes radiated. Again Tetsujo spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That new American envoy,&mdash;he with the nose of a sick
vulture and the fine yellow eye,&mdash;is he favorable to us? Is
he one that at all understands us?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, my father, he is of wonderful understanding. He
and Baron Kanrio are as brothers in thought. Did not Prince
Haganè speak of him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ignoring the question, Tetsujo went on. &quot;The younger of
the two women,&mdash;that straw-colored maiden who seems standing
on the edge of a small typhoon,&mdash;she, I suppose, is the
school friend, the Miss Todd, you referred to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Yuki, a little resentfully. &quot;And she is
considered beautiful. I think her augustly beautiful, even as
Amaterasu, our Sun Goddess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not ours. It may be that other nations have also sun
goddesses,&quot; said Tetsujo, significantly. &quot;To me all foreign
females are of hideous aspect. They look and strut like fowls.
And the two young males,&mdash;sons of Mr. Todd, I take it,&mdash;they
are as the painted toys sold in temple booths. Yet, if
the foreigners have been kind, it is well to express gratitude,
and to send gifts as costly as my purse will allow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Todds are rich,&mdash;very, very rich,&mdash;even as our great
silk merchants,&quot; cried Yuki, in indignation. &quot;They do not
want gifts, or expect them. It is not an American custom.
Gwendolen, my friend, my sister, wishes only to be with me,
freely, as we have been for four years past.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo considered. &quot;I could not refuse you a continuance
of friendship, my child, though I confess it will irk me greatly
to see those strange creatures on my mats. After the first few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
days of your home-coming,&mdash;in a week, perhaps,&mdash;you can
speak again of this desire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s heart sank. A week,&mdash;and she had promised to see
them to-morrow, perhaps this afternoon! She opened her
lips to remonstrate, and then thought better of it. If he felt
it a concession to admit Gwendolen, daughter of the new
American minister, what would he say to Pierre? Deliberately
she fought down the rising host of apprehensions.
&quot;No,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I shall not dwell upon it. I must not
spoil my home-coming with uncertain fears. I shall try to be
untroubled until I can tell my father all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Well along the top of the hill, Onda re-entered his
kuruma, and with the word &quot;hidari&quot; (left), started the little
string of vehicles down a path that ran in wavering lines
between hedges of various growths. Many were of dwarf
bamboo or sa-sa, other of a higher bamboo, springing from
resilient stems twenty feet in air. A few were of the small-leafed
d&#333;dan, a bush which turns to wet vermilion with the
frost. Several were of intertwisted thorn, a cruel and relentless
guardian. One showed a flat green wall like that of
a three-story city house jutting upon a pavement; but the
masonry was all of growth, rafters of thick stems, and facing
of the close-clipped evergreen mochi-tree. The small tiled gate
jutting from the centre of the lower edge seemed the entrance
of a cave. Doubtless behind this imposing and misleading
front nestled an unpretentious cot, a well-sweep, a small
vegetable and flower garden, and a handful of old trees.</p>

<p class="indent">Onda&#39;s gate, some hundreds of yards further to the north,
emerged in wooden simplicity from a sa-sa hedge. Along the
street the bamboo only showed. Within it ran a line of well-trained
thorn. This fence was characteristic of the race which
had planned it; Onda&#39;s father and grandfather, and many generations
before, had owned this spot of ground in Yedo.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo, although the first to arrive, remained in his kuruma,
while Iriya and Yuki made haste to descend. The
former went at once to the gate, pulling aside a thin wooden
panel. A little gate-bell jangled, and at the musical summons
wooden-shod feet were heard, running down the pathway from
the house. Old Suzumè, shrivelled, yellow, her black eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
darting excitement everywhere, fell on her knees in the gateway.
She began immediately to mutter a jumble of ceremonious
phrases, in the pauses drawing her breath with ferocious
energy. Behind her showed a moon-faced maiden, who stared
first, as if bewildered, and then suddenly fell to the earth
beside Suzumè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is sufficient,&quot; said Tetsujo, now descending and
pushing between them as he entered the gate. &quot;Here, Suzumè,
take my purse, and let these good rascals rob us as little as
possible. Go within, Maru, and prepare to remove the foreign
shoes from the feet of your young mistress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maru, quaking like a jelly, as she always did when addressed
directly by the &quot;august master,&quot; obeyed instantly, and knelt
at the stone house-step to receive the shoes. Suzumè unwillingly
remained at the gate to haggle with the three jinrikisha
men.</p>

<p class="indent">When the shoes were reverently drawn off, dusted on Maru&#39;s
blue striped apron, and set side by side on the stone step, the
little handmaid disappeared around the corner of the house.
A moment later was heard the scurrying of soft stockinged
feet within.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki stretched a hand toward the closed shoji.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, dear, wait an instant,&quot; said Iriya, hurriedly interposing.
&quot;Let Maru San open the shoji. She has been rehearsing
this for a year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki drew back. &quot;I have forgotten so many things,&quot; she
murmured, flushing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are not lost; they will spring quickly in the warm
rain of home love,&quot; said Tetsujo, behind them.</p>

<p class="indent">The shoji were sliding apart, both at once, with noiseless
precision. In the opening Maru&#39;s globe-like countenance
beamed. Now, for the first time, Iriya performed the equivalent
of an introduction. &quot;Maru San,&quot; she said, in her pleasant
voice, &quot;this is our o jo san (honorable young lady of the
house), Onda Yuki-ko, for whom we have been longing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai, o jo san! Go kigen y&#333;! Irasshai!&quot; palpitated the
little servant, asking her to enter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have written you often of Maru,&quot; Iriya went on, turning
to her daughter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
Tetsujo brushed unceremoniously through the group, and
strode alone to the big corner guest-room at the rear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is the orphaned child of Suzumè&#39;s dead husband&#39;s step*-son,&quot;
continued Iriya, placidly. &quot;About two years ago she
was left quite destitute, so of course her natural home was
here. Maru is a good girl, and of much help to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Mistress, Mistress,&quot; cried old Suzumè, nearly tripping
on her clogs to reach them, &quot;you know well that Maru is a
very cat in the sun for laziness.&quot; The speaker struggled hard
to look severe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai, hai,&quot; said Maru, in deprecating confirmation, and
bobbed over to the matting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, o jo san, in my opinion Maru is not worth the
honorable rice she puts in her gluttonous mouth,&quot; said
Suzumè, on a high note of satisfaction. &quot;Yet the kind mistress
here, besides food and occasional outworn garments,
allows her sixty sen each month for spending. Ah, Kwannon
Sama, of divine compassion, will reward our mistress for her
kind heart!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya laughed, a merry, low laugh, as young as Yuki&#39;s
own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you, Suzumè; but do you realize that the master
sits alone in the zashiki, with no tea, no coal, no&mdash;&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;D&#333;-mo!&quot; exclaimed the old woman, and scrambled rapidly
to her feet. &quot;But I become more and more the fool with
age, as a tree gathers lichen. I will attend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be at leisure, honorable, ancient relative; I will fetch the
tea,&quot; said Maru.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; cried Yuki, suddenly stretching out a hand; &quot;I want
to take it just as I used to as a little girl. I think it will
please my father. Let me take it, Suzumè San!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maru paused with round, incredulous eyes. &quot;Arà!&quot; cried
old Suzumè, scarcely knowing whether she were the more
pleased or astonished. &quot;A fashionable, wonderful young lady,
educated in America, with numberless young Japanese noblemen
waiting to marry her,&mdash;and she wishes to bear the tray
like a tea-house musumè! Ma-a-a! How strange! Yet it
is a good desire. The mistress&#39;s face shines with it. It shows
your heart has not changed color, o jo san. I will prepare at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
once. Come, lazy fatling!&quot; This last remark was of course
addressed to Maru.</p>

<p class="indent">In his wide, dim zashiki, or reception-room,&mdash;analogous to
the drawing-room of the West,&mdash;Tetsujo sat alone. He was
glad for a moment of solitude. His mind did not move swiftly
on any subject. The bewilderment of his first vision of Yuki,
changed from a clinging Japanese child to an alert, self-possessed
American, had not altogether passed. Then that
bobbing, blue-eyed he-creature on the hatoba,&mdash;he had given
sour food for thought. What language was it that the thing
had tried to speak, what wish to utter? Well, at least Yuki
was safe now among her home people, away from the influence
of all such mountebanks. In a few days she would be wishing
to don again her Japanese dress, and then he could begin to
believe he had a child.</p>

<p class="indent">The Onda residence faced directly to the north, thus giving
the big guest-chamber and the outlying garden a southern exposure.
Two sides of the room, the south and the west, had
removable shoji. The inner walls were partly of plaster,
partly of sliding, opaque panels of gold, called fusuma. These
were painted in war-like designs by Kano artists. To-day the
western shoji were all closed; but the sun, just reaching them,
shed a mellow tone of light throughout the room. All southern
shoji were out, admitting, as it were, the fine old garden as
part of the decoration of the room. The day had deepened into
one of those quite common to the Tokio winter, where the
sunshine battles with a white glamour, scarcely to be called
mist, and yet with the softening tone of it. No young spring
growth was waking in the garden. All was sombre-green,
ochre, or cold gray,&mdash;pines and evergreen azaleas, heaped
rocks, stone lanterns, bridge, and the pear-shaped water of a
pond. In line and structure the garden was still a thing of
beauty, planned in an artist&#39;s mind. It had the look of a
stained-glass window done in faded hues, of old tapestry, of
wrought metal. At the corner of the guest-room veranda
stood a huge old plum-tree just coming into white bloom.</p>

<p class="indent">Smiling Yuki, in tailor-made American gown and black
stockings, brought in the tray and knelt before her father.
The old warrior flushed with pleasure. &quot;Why, this is
better than I could have thought!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
&quot;I told you I was just your little girl,&quot; said Yuki. &quot;And
oh, father, I do feel so queerly young and real again! I see
everything around me just as I wish. It is like making things
come true in dreams.&quot; Tetsujo caught her by a slender
shoulder, looking deep, deep into answering eyes. For once,
no troubled thoughts rose to blur the vision. Suddenly he
smiled. &quot;Then make <i>my</i> dream come true, my Yuki; remove
the shapeless foreign garment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki sprang to her feet, laughing with delight. &quot;Yes,
yes, that is the next real thing to do, of course. I will borrow
a kimono from mother, as my trunks have not arrived. But
don&#39;t let them bring in dinner till I get back. I am so hungry
for a real dinner!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The soup shall not even be poured,&quot; promised Tetsujo.
She gave a little bow like the dart of a humming-bird, and
would have sped past him, but he, catching at a fold of her
skirt, detained her. She stopped, and seeing the expression
of his face, her own sobered. &quot;Welcome, my daughter,&quot;
said Tetsujo, in a tone that trembled; &quot;welcome, child of my
ancestors,&mdash;the last of an honorable race!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Next</span> to the zashiki, or guest-room, around by the corner of
the big plum-tree on which, now, great snowy pearls of buds
opened with every hour, was the master&#39;s benkyo-beya, or study,
where sets of Chinese and Japanese classics, often running
into a hundred volumes, had snug place in fragrant cabinets
of unvarnished cypress wood.</p>

<p class="indent">Contiguous to this, along the western side, and bounded
ten feet farther by the fusuma of her parents&#39; chamber, Yuki&#39;s
little sleeping-room was tucked away. The stately garden,
curving around by the plum-tree, spread here wider paths and
less pretentious hillocks. Just in front of Yuki&#39;s shoji and the
narrow veranda which ran unchecked along the south and west
of the house, two sedate gray stones led into a gravelled space.
Here were flower-beds somewhat in foreign fashion, but without
bordering plants or bricks. Many of the small bushes
were resultant from seed-packets mailed by Yuki in Washington.
Imported pansies, alyssum, geraniums, marigolds, and
ragged-robins grew here in springtime in friendly proximity
to indigenous asters, columbine, pinks, and small ground-orchids.
These flower spaces were now vacant but for tiny
springing communities of chrysanthemum shoots, bare stems
of peony with swollen red buds at the tip, and a few indispensable
small pines. Beyond it all was the tall hedge of sa-sa
shutting out the street, and its ugly inner rind of thorn.</p>

<p class="indent">The eastern side of the house contained, so to speak, its executive
offices, dining-room, servants&#39; quarters, pantry, kitchen,
and well-shed. Along this portion (except by the kitchen,
which stepped down unaided to a bare earth floor) strips of
narrow veranda and convenient stepping-stones led into a
vegetable garden, small wood-yard, and strawberry patch.
The longest bit of veranda had the dignity of a rail,&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
mere upright strip of board, edged heavily on top with bamboo,
and pierced with openings cut into the shapes of swallows.</p>

<p class="center">TETSUJO&#39;S HOUSE AND GARDEN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was here, the morning after Yuki&#39;s arrival, that the
women of the household were to be found. Suzumè chattered
incessantly as she washed the breakfast-dishes and passed
inward to arrange them on the pantry shelves. Little Maru
San, a few feet away, out in the sunshine of the garden,
scrubbed at pieces of a ripped-up kimono in a tub that stood
high on its own three legs. Afterward she rinsed the bits and
spread them smoothly to dry on a board. The tailless white
cat, disdainfully satiate after a meal of tea, rice, and fish-bones,
curled itself up in a fork of the bare persimmon-tree to sleep.
Maru&#39;s favorite bantam cock, followed at a respectful distance
by two wives and an unidentified black chick, sauntered along
the kitchen drain, his yellow eye slanted for a swimming flake
of white. The clear, windless air had a smell of new-washed
leaves and of foreign violets. Yuki&#39;s heart stirred with the
deep homeliness of it all. Iriya, noting her expression,
asked brightly, &quot;Is my dear one just a little happy to be at
home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, mother, not a little happy, but very, very happy. It
has been a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya was hanging out a bed-quilt of plaid silk, the squares
three feet across and of superb coloring. &quot;Yes,&quot; she repeated,
&quot;it has been a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you let me go at all?&quot; cried Yuki, passionately.
&quot;I was your only one. You must have missed me sorely.
Sometimes I feel that I never should have gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, my jewel.&quot; Iriya gave an apprehensive glance
toward the other side of the house. &quot;Say not such words
where the kind father may hear. He was so proud of you. It
was his dearest wish, and Lord Haganè, our daimyo, advised
it also. You see, we had no son, and Tetsujo was not willing
to give me up that another wife might bring this hope to pass.
He has been a good master to me, has Onda Tetsujo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A glow of loving pride softened the regret that this thought
of the son, that had not been given, always brought to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Suzumè looked up from her dish-tub, wrinkling with shrewd
smiles. &quot;You have no son&mdash;but what of it? Some day you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
will have a grand son-in-law, a young prince, maybe. Yuki-ko
will make a marriage to bring glory to us all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki drooped her head. &quot;I don&#39;t want to think of marriage
yet. I just want to stay here in this precious home and try to
win back some of those four long years which I have lost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you are nineteen, Miss Yuki,&mdash;nearer twenty, in
fact. A terrible age for a young lady of rank to be caught
single.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish it could be as you wish, my Yuki,&quot; sighed Iriya.
&quot;But, as Suzumè says, you are nearing twenty. I pray the
gods that my son-in-law may not be of too exalted station to
receive adoption into this family, instead of your being absorbed
into his. That would be the greatest joy life holds for
me. But, alas! I am a selfish, talkative old woman to let such
thoughts escape. I should wish your marriage to be only that
which may possibly serve your country and repay your father
for his sacrifices.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki lifted a small queer look. &quot;In America, where my
father sent me, I was taught, in the matter of marriage, to do
some of the thinking myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya caught her breath. Suzumè stopped washing to
stare. Maru, looking up with her round mouth formed for a
&quot;Ma-a-a!&quot; jostled the tub in her excitement. It went over
with a &quot;swash.&quot; The soapy water, with drifting islands of
blue cloth, flowed out swiftly, carrying the pompous bantam
and his family on the unexpected tide. The cat opened one
green eye, then the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, my child,&quot; said Iriya, quickly, to Yuki, &quot;condescend
to bear me company to the guest-chamber. I have the flowers
to arrange. Perhaps, in America, you have learned some new
and beautiful composition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s queer look deepened into a naughty little laugh and
shrug as she turned to obey. She knew perfectly why her
mother wished to get her from the hearing of Suzumè and
Maru. Tokio is not free from gossip, and, though Suzumè
was devoted to the family she served, she dearly loved the
start, the incredulity, the deepening interest of a listener&#39;s
face.</p>

<p class="indent">To her mother&#39;s last suggestion Yuki replied, &quot;I fear not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
mother. The only idea of arrangement they have in America
is to get many different flowers together, chop them to the
same length of stem, and push them down evenly into a shapeless
vase with other flowers painted on the sides.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Iriya, crestfallen and surprised, &quot;we shall not
then adopt the foreign arrangement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother and daughter clasped hands, swinging them as
children do, and moved along the narrow veranda. They
were now skirting the closed shoji of the dining-room. In
turning the corner, the plum-tree came into full sight. A
hundred blossoms must have opened since the dawn. Yuki
broke from her mother with a cry, ran to the tree, and threw
her arms about the great trunk. &quot;Oh, you are the most beautiful
tree in the whole world!&quot; she said aloud, and looked with
adoration up into its shining branches.</p>

<p class="indent">As Iriya reached her, she lowered her gaze. &quot;Do you remember,
mother, that morning four years ago, when I went
away, how I clung to this tree last of all, sobbing from my
heart the poem that my father taught me?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Though bereft and poor,</span><br />
<span class="i2">I in exile wandering</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far on mount and moor,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Happy plum beside my door,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Oh, forget not thou the spring.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember well,&quot; said Iriya, and drew her daughter&#39;s
outstretched hand to her cheek.</p>

<p class="indent">Something shone suddenly in Yuki&#39;s eyes. &quot;And I wept so
passionately that father, half in tears himself, came and entreated
me to cease. He said that if I shed more tears upon
it, his tree, like that of Michizanè, might rise through the air
and follow me to exile.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; smiled Iriya; &quot;often have I recalled it in the time
of spring, standing under this tree alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It really did follow me after all, you know,&quot; the girl went
on shyly. &quot;It came at night, in dreams, when you and father
could not miss it. Did it ever fail to return before the
dawn?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; returned Iriya, with deep gravity. &quot;The dear tree
loves us also. Never once did it fail to return.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Tetsujo strode toward them from his study. &quot;How can one
ponder on the classics, with pigeons cooing beneath his very
eaves?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki clung to him. &quot;You had the classics for four long
years when I was away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So had I water through those four long years, small
pigeon,&mdash;yet while I live must I thirst. The classics feed
deep wells of the soul.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put a strong, loving hand about her, and drew her near.
It sprang into Yuki&#39;s mind to speak now of her foreign
friends, to ask permission to visit them or, at least, to send
them her Tokio address. Pierre&#39;s beautiful face and blue
eyes reproached her. But this moment was too sweet for
jeopardy. She pressed her cheek against the rough blue cotton
of her father&#39;s shoulder. Iriya, stealing nearer, put also
a loving arm about the girl. The sunshine made a halo for
the three. The plum, loosening its first petals, sent them
down in fragrant benediction.</p>

<p class="indent">So her day passed, a wonderful day, steeped in love and
childish recollections. At night, the winds being chill, and
the fear of robbers inherent in the Japanese mind, all shoji,
and after them the wooden storm panels (amado), were tightly
drawn. In the ashes of the great brass hibachi balls of charcoal
glowed like incandescent apples. A lamp was suspended
from the ceiling, swinging but a few feet above their heads.
Here the four women of the household grouped themselves.
Tetsujo had gone out for a call. The pieces of kimono, ripped
and washed that morning by Maru San, were now to be refashioned.
Iriya, Suzumè, and Maru drew forth little sewing-boxes
and prepared for work. Yuki, half sitting, half lying
on the floor, fondled the tailless cat, and declared boldly that
she hated sewing and was not going to begin that part of a
Japanese woman&#39;s drudgery quite so early.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All good wives love sewing, particularly on the master&#39;s
nightclothes,&quot; said Suzumè, reprovingly, and peering over the
rim of huge horn spectacles toward the culprit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The o jo san will tell us something of foreign habits as
we sew,&quot; suggested Iriya, the peacemaker.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I will be what is called over there the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
bureau of information,&quot; laughed wilful Yuki. &quot;Any questions
from you, Mr. Cat?&quot; she cried, holding the drowsy
animal high above her and smiling into its blinking eyes.&mdash;&quot;Do
American cats like rice?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Queer cats, you
say,&mdash;and so they think of you.&quot; &quot;Do they wear tails?&quot;
&quot;Yes, long ones.&quot; &quot;What do they use them for?&quot; &quot;For
getting pinched in doors.&quot; &quot;No more questions, Pussy San?
Ah, you will never learn. Ruskin says that curiosity forms
tendrils of the mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What I would like to feel sure of, honorable young lady,
is this,&quot; began Suzumè, primly, with a disapproving glance
toward the cat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are ready, Madame Suzumè, speak on,&quot; said Yuki,
cuddling pussy back into her sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it really true, as newspapers and pictures say, that
women over there, even women of decent character, go to
evening entertainments with no clothes above the waist, dance
with red-faced men until they are on the verge of apoplexy,
and then have to be restored by much fanning and a cold
medicine called &#39;punch&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not altogether, good nurse,&quot; said Yuki, fighting hard to
retain a semblance of gravity. &quot;They wear cloth and flowers,
feathers and jewelry above the waist, and arrange them
with great beauty; but it is true that they dance with men,
and that their shoulders and arms are bare.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a strange custom,&quot; mused Suzumè. &quot;Even our
Sacred Empress condescends to go with bare arms. Why,
I wonder, do they wish to expose arms more than legs?
There is more leg, and in a supple young girl it is more
shapely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is too hard a thing for me,&quot; laughed Yuki. &quot;Well,
Maru, your eyes are big and solemn like the Owl San in our
pine. What is your question?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maru, after much giggling and blushing, confessed to a desire
to know, once for all, whether foreigners had toes like real
people, or whether, as she had been assured from childhood,
they possessed but a single horny hoof, which, from desire to
hide the ugliness, they kept in pointed leather cases known
as shoes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
&quot;That is false entirely. I have seen hundreds of barefoot
children in America, and they all had ten toes, even as we.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maru seemed cast down. &quot;Ma-a-a! what foolish tales are
spread,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Doubtless the foreigners have
similar strange beliefs of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is what the great creatures eat that turns me sick,&quot; cried
old Suzumè, and nearly perforated a finger in her vehemence.
&quot;Their soup is like the contents of a slop-bucket, with warm
grease swimming on the top. The stuff would choke in a decent
person&#39;s throat. And then the great heaps of animal
flesh,&mdash;and greasy vegetables, and implements like gardener&#39;s
tools to eat them with! And then&mdash;Kwannon preserve us&mdash;the
unspeakable nightmares that come even after the tasting
of such food!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arà!&quot; cried the maid, roused to new excitement by this
recital of horror, &quot;it is said that America is an honorably
highly civilized country, and Nippon merely a divine half-civilized
country, but I thank the gods who have given me to
live in this half-civilized country.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">At bedtime, Yuki, creeping between soft, fragrant futons,
drew a deep sigh of childish content. The andon in the corner,
shedding its gentle, paper-screened light, continued the
impression of sunshine. The girl smiled to find herself again
counting the lapped cedar boards of the ceiling, &quot;Hitotsu&mdash;futatsu&mdash;mitsu&mdash;yotsu&mdash;&quot;
following them into uncertain
dimness at the far end of the chamber. As in childhood she
speculated upon the possibilities of that small black knot-hole
left vacant in the wood. How much smaller now it was than
four years ago! Still there was a chance, a pygmy probability,
that a very small nedzumi might creep through, and, falling to
the floor, scamper over mats and bedding, and&mdash;here came
the shudder!&mdash;over the very face of a sleeper. She drew the
bedclothes up spasmodically, then smiled to think how bright
would be the eyes of the little mouse, twinkling in semi-darkness.
In a moment more, with the smile still on her lips, she
was asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">So a second day passed, and a third,&mdash;hushed, golden days,
too precious to be imperilled. With the fourth morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
Sunday, came a change. In the night a storm had risen,
sweeping down from Kamschatka along the Yezo coast to the
wide unsheltered plain of Yedo. Here it wallowed like a
great beast in a field, snorting with fury, crushing trees, fences,
and houses, and fighting back the black clouds that would
have crowded in upon it.</p>

<p class="indent">Through Yuki&#39;s troubled sleep came the sounds of vehicles
rattling on foreign streets, and the blurred chime of church-bells.
Her first conscious thought was, &quot;It is Sunday.
Gwendolen and I must be sure to go to service.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The wooden amado of the house chattered with fright. The
wind gave long, derisive howls as it swept under the low-hanging
roof, clutched and shook the rafters, and then darted
out to the heart of the storm once more. Yuki realized slowly
that she was not in America at all, that she was at home, in
Tokio. With a slower, heavier recognition came the knowledge
that her friend Gwendolen was here also, and if she were
in Washington could not seem more remote.</p>

<p class="indent">She heard old Suzumè and Maru straining to open the
amado, then Tetsujo&#39;s voice calling loudly from his chamber,
&quot;Keep them all shut on the eastern side!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear plum-tree! It will be torn like mist,&quot; said
the girl aloud. She sat upright, patting instinctively the
loops of her hair, dressed now in Japanese fashion. The
floating wick of her andon fell over the edge of the saucer and
went out, leaving the room in grayer darkness. The foreign
clock that hung in the kitchen rang out the hour of seven.
&quot;What gloom! The storm must be terrible indeed!&quot; A
moment after the girl said, with a shudder, &quot;This is the day
on which I am to speak of my love. I hear his voice calling
through the wind. I must wait no longer. Yes, I will speak
to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At breakfast the small family of three was silent and preoccupied.
The one glimpse they had taken of the shivering,
naked plum-tree would have sufficiently accounted for the
depression. Iriya and Yuki sat a little behind the master,
eating from their small rice-bowls, and attending in turn
upon his wants. As Suzumè crept in to remove the half-emptied
dishes, Yuki said to her father, &quot;Father, a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
later, when you have smoked and read your paper, may I
speak with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, certainly, my child,&quot; said Tetsujo, kindly, looking
up from the damp printed sheet he had already unfurled;
&quot;though I may have but few thoughts apart from this terrible
storm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a terrible storm,&quot; shuddered Iriya. &quot;A great camphor-tree
in the Zen Temple garden has fallen. It was a
goblin-tree, and the priests fear evil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I spoke not of the storm in the material universe, but of
that vast political tempest brewing over us. Our minister
leaves St. Petersburg to-morrow. War has practically come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No comment was made. The three tacitly avoided, each,
the glance of the other. Iriya rose quietly, then Yuki. In
the door-frame the girl paused. &quot;I shall return in half an
hour, father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo nodded. &quot;I shall be here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In her own room Yuki moved about mechanically, putting
into place her few indispensable possessions,&mdash;a silver brush,
comb, and hand-glass, her white prayer-book and neat Bible, a
picture of Gwendolen in a burnt-leather frame, and a lacquered
box containing a second photograph, not of Gwendolen, and
a package of letters, all addressed in the same hand. She
fought to keep her imagination from the coming war. Its
dark omen only strengthened her determination to have
things understood. She prayed for strength and self-control.
Punctual to the moment she entered the guest-room, bowing
again to her father. He looked up from his brooding revery.
Something in the girl&#39;s face made him ask, &quot;Ah, have you
indeed a matter of importance? My little Yuki has gone.
This is a woman who comes to speak with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alas, father. Childhood, like the petals of the plum-tree,
vanishes at the breath of storms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What storm can have found you so early, my little one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki drew in a long breath, and steadied herself for a deliberate
reply. In the pause Tetsujo leaned out, and with one
motion of his powerful hand flung a panel of the shoji to one
side, giving a view of the drenched and storm-tormented
garden. On the veranda floor, usually so smooth, beaten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
plum-petals clung like bits of white leather. The drip from the
low-tiled roof enclosed them in the bars of a silver cage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is my distress, father,&quot; began Yuki. &quot;I am a Japanese
girl, with my first loyalty toward you and my native
country;&mdash;yet, in that new land where you sent me,&mdash;I
have come&mdash;I have grown honorably to feel, almost without
warning, the&mdash;influence of a&mdash;person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo looked faintly surprised. &quot;Indeed, I trust so, my
child. You would be but a poor, unresponsive creature to
have felt no influences. It is from such things that character
and knowledge are builded. There were many persons who
influenced you, I take it,&mdash;some for good, perhaps some for
evil. To an intelligent mind a warning is valuable. Now, at
home, you will have the leisure to sort and adapt such impressions,
casting away those that are trivial and employing those
which may be of service to Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is augustly as you indicate, dear father,&quot; returned
Yuki, the distress in her dark eyes deepening. &quot;I attempted
to observe many things. But the influence I spoke of is not
that kind you are thinking. It&mdash;it&mdash;is a very special influence.
In America they call it&mdash;love.&quot; She bowed her
head over slightly. A faint pink tide of embarrassment
showed on her forehead and in the small bared triangle of
her throat.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo controlled himself well. &quot;You mean&mdash;love&mdash;&#39;ai&#39;&mdash;the
love of a man and a woman who wish to marry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In America one thinks very differently of such matters,&quot;
said Yuki, her eyes still lowered. &quot;Yet I suppose the feeling
is honorably the same everywhere. Yes, father, it is of such
love that I now must tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have many Japanese terms for Love,&quot; mused Tetsujo.
&quot;Love of country, of Our Emperor, of parents, of beauty, of
virtue,&mdash;but the term which you now employ should not be
spoken by a samurai to a woman not his wife. You pay a
high price for Western knowledge, my poor child, if already
the dew-breath of modesty has dried from your young life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;I am still a Japanese. I know
how it must seem to you. I suffer in the speaking, but still
I must speak. I promised. I must speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
&quot;You promised?&quot; echoed Tetsujo, and looked more keenly
into her shrinking face. &quot;To whom could you have promised
such a thing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To him&mdash;that one&mdash;I first alluded to.&quot; She did not
attempt now to meet his eyes, but fingered nervously along
the edge of her sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can it be possible that in that country unmarried youths
speak in unmannerly directness to young women of such intimate
affairs? I had heard a hint of this unbelievable
indelicacy, and once your mother, Iriya, hinted that we
should warn you. But I scoffed then at the thought of your
needing the admonition. Alas! being a woman, she knew you
better than I.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His head sank forward. Yuki twisted her slim hands into
wisps. &quot;In America all speak of these things, father. They
think us immodest for other reasons, and foolishly sensitive
in this. The schoolgirls talk&mdash;and the matrons. All
theatres treat of it&mdash;and books are full of it. You sent me
no warning&mdash;I could not know, of myself. Please, honorably,
restrain anger against me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must not be angry,&quot; muttered Tetsujo, who now gave
every symptom of a rising storm of wrath. &quot;I must be
calm. But gods! this is a foul spectre to meet at the very
outset! Am I to understand that this man&mdash;this person&mdash;spoke
directly to you, and you listened without first receiving
permission from your parents? He could have gone,
at least, to my friend, and my country&#39;s representative, Baron
Kanrio.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, father,&quot; cried the girl, &quot;you <i>are</i> becoming angry.
I did not have the time to reflect. In America one does things
first and thinks about them afterward. I am not sure that
person ever has even met&mdash;our noble baron.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If she hoped to palliate by this last disclosure she was
quickly undeceived. &quot;The gamester&mdash;the oaf! Insolent
fool! An impostor unknown even by sight to your natural
guardian in a distant land! He must be an alien! No
Japanese&mdash;not even a Yedo scavenger&mdash;could have been
guilty of that misdeed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he spoke quite openly to my best American friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
the Todds,&quot; said Yuki, desperately. Tetsujo&#39;s rising excitement
and anger lapped like flames about this new thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that Mr. Todd, now come to be minister in our
very home,&mdash;did he encourage your filial impiety?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was not so much Mr. Todd as Madame, his wife, and my
schoolmate, Gwendolen,&quot; admitted Yuki, with a sinking heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I might have known it,&quot; said Tetsujo. His relief
was evident. &quot;Only women! Mere cackling geese. America
echoes to their shrill voices. That is of no consequence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that country women are of much consequence, and
everyone speaks openly of affairs of love and&mdash;marriage,&quot;
persisted Yuki, who now clung half hopelessly to this one
tangible point.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you yourself&mdash;ingrate&mdash;would willingly bestow
yourself, without a word from me or your mother, upon a
man who is a stranger, and whose conduct, heard from your
partial lips, impresses me as characteristic of a fool and an
outcast?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His brows were black and twitching. Yuki knew that she
must take her stand now or never. &quot;You see only the side
of Japanese convention, father. I have given to him a promise.
When your consent and that of my mother are gained, I
shall be glad to be his wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo started convulsively, then controlled himself. The
sudden checking in of passion recoiled through the very air.
With rigid hands he stuffed and lighted his small pipe. When
he spoke his voice sounded flat and hollow, like beaten wood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such a promise, unratified by me, of course means nothing,
unless&mdash;it be defiance of heaven and of natural decency.
It binds no one&mdash;you least of all. Consider it unsaid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki looked directly upon him. Her soft feminine chin
grew a little squarer, more like his. &quot;That promise is given,
father. Neither you nor I have power to recall it. It has
gained a living growth in the soul of a third person.&quot; She
turned half-closed eyes to the garden. Tetsujo went forward
in two small stiff jerks. His eyes fastened on her face, as
though he saw it for the first time. Veins swelled in his
neck, and the fingers on his small pipe-stem grew slowly flat,
like the heads of adders.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
&quot;Is that you speaking, Onda Yuki?&quot; he asked. &quot;The
gods grant that I wake from this dream! But if it be reality,
then sorrow is to come. If this man be a foreigner, let him
stay in his own land! You are mine utterly,&mdash;at my disposal
in marriage as in all else. There are ways, in Japan, to curb
such mad demons as those that now look at me through your
eyes. Go! leave me. I shall hear no more of this,&mdash;or else
it may be that I shall forget my fatherhood, as you your
obligations. Go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father,&quot; said Yuki, quietly, &quot;you must hear more of this
or drive me from the house. You owe me consideration and
justice; for the ideas that I have, you yourself sent me to
America to gain. You even let me be a Christian. With the
Christians marriage is a sacred thing&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be still!&quot; said Tetsujo, in a terrible, low voice. His pipe
dropped to the floor. The coal burrowed itself, a charred and
smoking ring, into the fragrant matting. The odor was that
of field-grass burning. The man rocked himself to and fro
for control. His lean hands plunged deep into his sleeves,
and grasped, one each, a jerking arm. He was terrified at his
own obsession of fury, and his soul warned him against a
yielding to his madness. His greenish twisted lips writhed
horribly once or twice before the next words came. One
corner of his mouth went far down at the corner. His words
hissed from a small distorted aperture near the chin. &quot;You
were allowed to turn Christian for the acquiring knowledge of
their foolish&mdash;creed. I believed that the soul of a samurai&#39;s
daughter,&mdash;of my daughter,&mdash;would be untainted by the
immoral portions of their doctrine. I see now my credulity!
Gods! I will consume myself with this heat! When you
marry&mdash;wench,&mdash;which shall be soon,&mdash;if your Japanese
husband approves not of Christianity, you will cease to be
Christian!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two pairs of eyes met, hard, flashing, defiant. Yuki
rose to her feet. He sprang after her. His right hand now
felt instinctively for the sword-hilts which should have been
at his hip. The leering, down-drawn mouth twitched and
writhed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your words do not lash from me my heritage of race!&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
she cried aloud. &quot;I am still your daughter,&mdash;a samurai&#39;s
daughter!&quot; With a movement like light she stripped back
her left sleeve, baring a white, blue-threaded arm. &quot;Because
I am a samurai&#39;s daughter I refuse a coward&#39;s obedience!
Hot blood of a samurai stings these veins no less than those
bronze arteries you clutch. Show me reason and I will listen.
Apart from that I defy you! I shall be faithful to the man
I love even though your legal rights prevent our happiness.
Turn me into the street,&mdash;slay me with your own hand,&mdash;I
shall not be compelled into a marriage of your choosing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Onda clutched his throat. The breath came gurgling like a
liquid. For an instant it seemed as if he must hurl himself
bodily upon her. Then he stumbled backward against the
plaster wall of the room, clawing at its tinted surface. Yuki&#39;s
eyes never left him. Now he lurched again toward her, then
fell back, shaken like a jointed puppet by his own consuming
rage. &quot;Gods of my Ancestors! Demons of the deepest
Hell! Go, go!&mdash;lest indeed I slay you. You fiend&mdash;you
hannia! From my sight, I say!&mdash;I cannot endure&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He cowered again, striking himself into temporary blindness
with one powerful fist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go, father, in obedience,&mdash;not in fear,&quot; said the girl&#39;s
clear voice. He sprawled forward, and fell, sobbing like an
exhausted runner. Yuki covered her face and went.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">With</span> the Imperial Restoration in Japan&mdash;an event, in time,
just thirty-five years before the date mentioned at the beginning
of this story&mdash;many of the nobles of Japan met with
ruin. This was especially the case with the &quot;hatamoto,&quot;
a class directly dependent for revenue and patronage upon the
favor of the usurping &quot;Shogun.&quot; The real Emperor, then a
boy of sixteen, living in seclusion at Kioto, was still nominal
ruler and spiritual head of the government, forming a sort of
&quot;Holy Roman Empire,&quot; translated into terms of Buddhism.
When, as a result of revolution and many sharp, fierce battles,
this boy was brought in triumph to take his rightful place as
temporal ruler also, with a new court in the great capital of
Tokio, the Shogun, direct descendant of the mighty Iyeyasu,
went into dignified retirement. Over-rich monasteries and
temples, arrogant after centuries of Tokugawa benefice, were
forced to part with broad lands, and even, in certain instances,
with personal treasure. The simpler &quot;Shinto&quot; faith, an indigenous
nature-spirit and ancestor-worshipping creed, opposed
its principles to gorgeous Buddhist forms. The pure spirit of
the younger faith and the profundities of its philosophy did
not suffer. The blow was aimed at externals. The child-like
Japanese soul to-day kneels with equal sincerity at a wayside
Shinto shrine or before the gold-hung altars of Sakyamuni.</p>

<p class="indent">This revolution, then, was threefold and complete. Politics,
religion, society, shifted within their national circle and
assumed new aspects. The centre of all was the young ruler,
Mutsuhito. Now the &quot;kugè,&quot; or court nobles of Kioto, who
had willingly shared retirement and comparative poverty with
this true descendant of the gods, came again into power. But
besides these two classes, the hatamoto and other dependent
samurai, and the kugè, was still a third,&mdash;the most important,&mdash;the
daimyo or feudal lords of the empire. Some among these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
had never yet given satisfactory hostages to the Shoguns, and
lived always in a state of insolent pride and suppressed insurrection.
At need of their Emperor, the true mettle of their
loyalty rang out. Men, money, lives, property, were poured
out like water for this beloved cause. Those who had been
haughtiest to the Shoguns bowed now in deepest reverence
to the boy Mutsuhito, in whose veins ran the blood of their
ancient dynasty. He was to them truly divine; not in the impossible,
superstitious sense, but as a sort of human channel
flowing between the old gods and modern men. Through him
were reconstruction and new national glory to be gained. A
life laid down in his cause were but newly come alive.</p>

<p class="indent">Prominent among such patriots was the old Daimyo of
Konda, father of the present Prince Haganè. His title more
literally translated would be that of &quot;Duke,&quot; or &quot;Feudal
Prince.&quot; His lands, lying far to the south, with a rough channel
to divide them from the mainland, held almost a separate
and independent existence. His chief province, and the one
from which he took his title, was Konda. &quot;Haganè&quot; was
the family name. At the first hint of national uprising the
old daimyo, abandoning his own loved home, came at once to
Kioto, and later made the journey with the young Emperor
to Yedo. By right he assumed the place of guardian and adviser.
The old daimyo was, as it chanced, somewhat learned
in foreign matters, and this, in spite of the Shogun&#39;s rigid
exclusion of all things foreign, of the death-penalty to any
Japanese attempting to leave Japan, or, having managed to
leave, attempting to return. This was a mighty armor of
self-protection to the Tokugawa policy; but, in common with
most armor, it had just one small flaw. In this case the flaw
was a tiny island, granted to the Dutch, called &quot;Deshima.&quot;
Not far from the Konda borders lay this innocent fleck of
earth, surrounded by blue native seas, and overgrown, like
other islands, with tall feathery bamboo, camellia, and camphor
trees; and yet, because of its existence, Haganè gained
foreign books,&mdash;from it he smuggled a Dutch interpreter who
could read and write not only his own language, but Japanese.
Other curious minds drew near this spring of knowledge;
and, partly because of it, long before Perry&#39;s expedition to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
the Far East, the Japanese people had become restless, eager,
awake, and in ferment for a national readjustment.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè&#39;s one son, Sanètomo, a few years older than the
boy Emperor, and reared as nearly in friendship with him as
reverence would allow, was among the first youths of his class
to travel in Europe, and to acquire any European language.
Upon his father&#39;s death, he was asked by the Emperor to
take at once the offices and semi-royal prerogatives of the
lamented elder statesman. All the daimyos had received
national bonds for the alienation of their fiefs; and thus
those who had been most powerful still enjoyed great wealth
in their own right.</p>

<p class="indent">With the Emperor once firmly established, etiquette and
the restrictions of court-life began to prove irksome to Sanètomo.
One could have continued to practise fine manners
under the Shoguns. Here to-day was something better. A
new army was to be formed; after that a new navy. Haganè
advised adaptation of tactics from the German military school,
its unbending automatonism appearing to him a safe restriction
for enthusiastic beginners. From the first, however, his
mind had been fixed upon the administrative methods of that
marvellous small heart of an enormous empire, England. Japan
should be to the Far East what England had become to the
West. What one island had accomplished, that also could
another do.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese nation as a whole went reeling drunk with
over-potations of foreign ideas. For a while it seemed that
everything Japanese was to be swept away. The small opposition
party, frenzied by the apparition, took hideous revenge
in murder, assassination, and suicide. Haganè&#39;s faith
did not for a moment waver. After excess comes nausea,
reaction. So had his countrymen, in more than one epoch
now long past, drunk in the new. In time they would reject
the unneedful, and infuse new power in what they had adopted.
The thinkers of his empire could afford to wait.</p>

<p class="indent">When the new constitution was promulgated in February,
1889, there was rejoicing such as this old earth seldom sees.
Haganè was created Minister of War. This position he had
continued to hold, with varying intervals. He was now the incumbent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
Much of his time was spent, perforce, in the &quot;foreign&quot;
official residence, well within sight of the Imperial moats.
Most of such edifices in Tokio are depressing. This was particularly
cheerless. The house of brick, wood, and plaster,
chiefly plaster, stood full two stories high, was of ample dimensions,
and had a huge, square, blue-tiled roof. Though planned
and built by the most artistic nation now alive, it had not one
line of beauty, nor one successful effort after fine proportion.
In these early days it seemed an accepted creed among the
Japanese that anything to be truly &quot;foreign&quot; must necessarily
offend the eye; yet, thought the ingenuous pupils,
since ugliness apparently goes in the company of wealth,
power, material welfare, and political recognition,&mdash;why, by
all means, let us be uglier than the foreigners themselves!</p>

<p class="indent">Around the house lay something called a garden, a watery
emulsion of American flower beds and a Japanese landscape
creation. The effect of the whole place was amorphous,
unstable, depressing, with the one redeeming feature of bigness.</p>

<p class="indent">Onda Tetsujo, speeding toward this haven in his hired
jinrikisha, rattled along the uneven stone of the street, and
then turned into the one great entrance of the imposing shell.
The garden wall had a secret gate or two, but these were generally
kept bolted. The storm of the early morning was
abating. A drizzling, discouraged rain, with irregular gusts
of wind through it, persisted in efforts to exclude all cheer.
Onda knocked at one of the rear doors of the Japanese wing,
and was but little surprised to hear, from the man who
opened for him, that his Excellency the Prince, having transacted
all official business for the day, had now retired to his
&quot;besso&quot; (villa) on the high land of suburban &quot;Tabata.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Onda re-entered his vehicle and gave the curt order,
&quot;Tabata.&quot; In the street he added, &quot;Call an atoshi, and pull
up the hood and oil-cloth.&quot; An atoshi, or &quot;Mr. After,&quot; was
summoned, the oil-cloth hood of the jinrikisha drawn far over
and held in place by a single black cord knotted to one
shaft. A sort of oil-cloth lap-robe, hung up in front and
hooked to the inner lining of the hood, afforded complete immunity
from wetting. Within the careful adjustment sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
Tetsujo, blinking and scowling. The day had brought him a
new and unwelcomed experience,&mdash;defiance from a woman.
He wondered, as he was dragged along the viscid street,
whether, in the happy, vanished feudal days, any warrior of
his clan had known a similar indignity. There was on record
the case of a wilful bride who, married against her wishes to
an Onda chief, had disguised herself in a suit of armor grown
too small for him, and sought heroic death in battle. But
even this was better than open insult and defiance. Well,
Yuki must be watched closely. Her education and beauty
were not to be thrown away on a foreigner who, likely as not,
would tire of and desert her. She must marry a young Japanese
already well along on the way to official or military promotion.
When this Russian war came, Japan would need all
her people, men and women. His only child should not be
given over to the loose affections of a foreigner. He scowled
anew at the thought, and gave so savage a sound that his
coolies stopped short in the road to inquire whether the
honorable master were in pain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; growled Tetsujo, in return, &quot;a warrior does not feel
pain; that is for babes and women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A few minutes later the redoubled grunts and groans of his
bearers&mdash;evidently sharing shamelessly the weaker prerogatives
of the other sex&mdash;told Tetsujo that they had begun the
ascent of the Tabata slope. At the eastern edge, where the
hill goes down like a cliff, and one looking far out over rice-fields
sees the Sumida River finding a shining road to Tokio,
and the great twin peaks of Tsukuba-yama standing guard
over the other half of the world, spread the broad eaves of
Prince Haganè&#39;s villa.</p>

<p class="indent">Onda gave a sigh of relief as he stepped out under the
door-roof.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O tanomi moshimasu!&quot; (I make request) he called, rapping
on the closed shoji panels with his knuckles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai!&quot; came almost instantly from within, and a housemaid
was on her knees pushing the panels softly aside, a hand
on each.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The august one&mdash;is he within?&quot; asked the visitor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai! Illustrious Sir. Deign to mount the step, and, seating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
yourself on the hard mats, be refreshed by our tasteless
tea and worthless cakes, while I hasten to announce your joy-giving
appearance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo dismissed his kuruma men, shook off his shoes, and
remained seated on the mats, still with folded arms, still deep
in thought. The little maid, returning quickly, murmured
that &quot;the noble master would receive his honorable guest at
once.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Prince Haganè sat alone in the great room, immediately
surrounded by boxes and trays with tea, writing, and smoking
outfits. There was one beautiful hibachi, or firepot, of hammered
brass. An English book on International Law lay on
the floor beside him among newspapers in Japanese, Chinese,
English, French, and German. Passages in these papers had
been heavily marked by the blue and red pencil still held in
the reader&#39;s hand. He did not rise or bow as Tetsujo entered,
merely turning his face toward the opened fusuma and
saying, &quot;Most welcome, good Tetsujo. Enter and forget the
storm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear I have brought the storm in with me, your Highness,&quot;
Tetsujo could not refrain from crying. He fell on his
knees just within the door, bowed many times, and drew in
his breath loudly. Haganè lifted an unread newspaper and
made several markings while Tetsujo continued his genuflections.
Having at last completed a number satisfactory to
his sense of propriety, he sat upright. Haganè folded this
last paper, and put it into a heap with the others.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Draw nearer,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;It is a day for
a chat between old friends. No, be not so humble&mdash;nearer
yet&mdash;I insist. Now&mdash;that is better and more companionable.
Pour yourself some tea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honors are heaped upon your unworthy servant,&quot; rejoined
Onda, pouring tea, first for the prince, then for himself. &quot;I
have just come from the official residence of your Highness.
How cold and un-homelike appear all foreign houses; while
this&mdash;&quot; he paused to look slowly around&mdash;&quot;this warms a
man&#39;s heart to see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Though insignificant, it has a certain restfulness,&quot; admitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
the host. &quot;Lacking a mistress, it cannot seem in
reality a home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo&#39;s face clouded. &quot;Speak not to me of mistresses,
Lord,&quot; he mumbled sourly.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè gave him a queer glance, but said nothing. He
understood well the nature of his own kerai. So angular a
thought as now distressed him must soon work its way to the
surface of speech. &quot;To-day I am in mind of the Chinese
sage who taught us that all women are mere manifestations
of demoniac force. They are sent here to tempt us&mdash;to test&mdash;to
torment. Would that I could reach a heaven of warriors,
untainted by their sex&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely, my Tetsujo,&quot; interrupted Haganè, gravely, &quot;those
of your household bring no torment. I have never known a
better wife than Iriya.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I complain not of Iriya,&quot; said the other, a hint of excitement
creeping into his voice; &quot;but, Lord, had you seen that
ingrate that I must call my daughter! Had you seen Yuki an
hour since, you would have perceived what the Chinese mean
by she-demons.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki!&quot; echoed Haganè, this time in genuine surprise.
&quot;Is there not some mistake? Yuki is spirited; but I cannot
picture her as a&mdash;demon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will honorably relate the event. My heart, with the
memory, seethes and bubbles as a small cauldron.&quot; In a voice
often shaken from control by passion, with a dark countenance
slowly deepening into a bronze red of agitation, Tetsujo imparted
the story of his child&#39;s defiance. Not once did Prince
Haganè lift his head, not even when Tetsujo, beating the
matted floor in his rage, roared out, &quot;Her eyes flashed, my
Lord, like those of a dragon-maid in battle! They scorched
me like sparks! They would not fall though I sent out the
whole volume of my will to quench them. It was defiance&mdash;defiance&mdash;naked
and unashamed! The very air around
me turned to flame. Murder dried my tongue. Had I worn
my short swords as of old,&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè gave an exclamation and looked up. &quot;What then!
Are you yourself a demon, Tetsujo,&mdash;or a father? Scorn to
you, thus speaking of a maid! It was your own strong spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
darting upon you from her bright eyes. Gods! the look of
her must have been magnificent!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Magnificent! Yes, as hell, perhaps, is magnificent! Think
you not, Lord, that she deserves death for such impiety?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My poor Tetsujo,&quot; said Haganè, &quot;I pray you, quaff more
tea and be calm. You alone cannot walk backward, when the
rest of the nation races to the fore. Yuki&#39;s death for such
a cause would certainly mean your hanging, and, in my
opinion, a fate that you would well deserve. Come now, let
us reason like men, not squirm and crackle like live devil-fish
thrown upon coals. The point of the matter is, that your
daughter wishes to marry one of her choice, and not one of
yours. Naturally, you oppose this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oppose!&quot; echoed Tetsujo, straining in his seat, &quot;I forbid
it! I defy her to attempt it! Should she persist, she shall
have my curse and that of my ancestors&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, nay, my Tetsujo, be calm. Anger is the worst
leak in a man&#39;s store of self-respect. I cannot talk further
until you grow calm.&quot; He paused and slowly poured for himself
a cup of tea, as if to give the old warrior time for self-recollection.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo drew a tenugui from his sleeve, mopped his damp
brow, pulled his kimono collar into smoother folds, and settled,
by degrees, into an appearance of tranquillity. Now and again
a small convulsive shudder still passed over him, a movement
involuntary and uncontrollable, such as is seen in a runaway
horse brought suddenly to a stand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now let me question,&quot; began Haganè&#39;s deep tones again.
&quot;Answer nothing, my friend, but what I ask. Are you certain
that this man, whom our little Yuki thinks she loves, is,
indeed, a foreigner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not honorably certain, your Highness, even of so
much. But I think he is a foreigner. No Japanese, not even
a street scavenger of Yedo, as I told her&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè raised a hand for silence. &quot;You should, first of
all, have ascertained his race, his name, and his profession.
He may be a hired Russian spy for all we know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo almost bounded from his place. &quot;A Russian spy!
God of Battles,&mdash;I thought not of that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
&quot;And did you bethink you to inquire whether the&mdash;person&mdash;had
already followed her to this country?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo&#39;s eyes rolled fearfully. He found no ready words.
&quot;My Lord&mdash;my Lord&mdash;&quot; he gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You now perceive, Tetsujo, there are better things for a
man to do with his wits than ignite them, and, with the burning
bits, play a foolish jugglery. Our first concern is to find
out whether or not that man is here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo bowed over to hide his chagrin. &quot;Your wisdom is
that of D&#333;-ku and Benkei Sama in one,&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè stuffed and lighted a small pipe. &quot;When you met
your daughter on the hatoba at Yokohama were there young
males of the party?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai, master. I recall now two strange and alert ones who
appeared to be young.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was one of a pink color, like buds of a kaido bloom, and
eyes a deep-blue color?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All were red and hideous. The one who tried to speak
with me had rice-straw on his head in place of decent hair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Haganè, puffing at his pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your Highness, and in our conversation she informed
me that the Todds were well aware of her shameful passion,
and that the women upheld it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silence fell between the men. Tetsujo bit his finger-nails
in his impatience.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In three more days,&quot; began the other, slowly, &quot;Mr. Todd
will be formally presented to his Sacred Majesty; after that
ceremony he will not, I think, permit his women to aid Yuki
in a marriage which is against your wishes and&mdash;mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Onda gave a joyful start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait,&quot; said Haganè, &quot;there is more to be said; I must
take a moment&#39;s counsel with myself.&quot; At these words he
fell into a reverie so profound that his spirit seemed to be
absent from his breathing body.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo controlled himself as best he could. The whole
affair was galling to his pride. He resented even Haganè&#39;s
knowing of the indignity; yet he had no recourse but
Haganè. The rain-water, trickling with a sound of dull clinking
coins down the tin corner-spouts, irritated him to madness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
He hated the little wet sparrows who sat up under the eaves
and exchanged uncomplimentary remarks about the weather.
Haganè&#39;s power of concentration was in itself reproof and
another source of irritation. The great man came to himself
without a start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen, Onda Tetsujo, I will offer advice, but it must be
taken entire. I will have no variation, mind you, or personal
addition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall receive it humbly, on my head,&quot; grumbled the
kerai.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè controlled a smile. &quot;Upon your return, treat the
maiden gently. Defiance is her best armor. We must not be
harsh. Win her confidence by renewed kindnesses. If possible,
bend your haughty will to the point of expressing regret
for this morning&#39;s anger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excuse myself to a woman&mdash;to my own daughter!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not insist upon that point. I said only if it were
possible. Some things are not possible, even to a Buddha.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And this is even such,&quot; cried Tetsujo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let it pass. My purpose may be accomplished without.
It is indispensable, however, that you be kind. Give to her,
unsolicited, permission to invite the women of the Todd family
to your home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This, too, is difficult,&quot; muttered Tetsujo; &quot;but with the
aid of Fudo Bosatsu (Bodhisàttwa of the Fiery Immovability)
I can achieve it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excellent,&quot; said the other; &quot;now for my part. I will,
on the day of Mr. Todd&#39;s presentation, arrange for a banquet
here at Tabata, to which I will invite the family of Mr.
Todd and also the two young men whom you saw at Yokohama.
If Yuki&#39;s foreign lover is here at all, he is of that
party.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not worthy of such deep thought and consideration
at your hands, Lord,&quot; said Tetsujo, gratefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be not deceived. It is for Yuki&#39;s sake as well. Since
her early childhood I have watched with deep interest the
growth of her fine intellect and the development of her
unusual beauty. Lacking children of my own, I have felt
something of a father&#39;s affection for her. I too wish to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
her for Japan. I approve not the thought of a foreign
marriage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo lifted his head. &quot;One question more, your Highness.
Is it your belief that Yuki will surely betray herself, if
indeed the foreign devil whom she&mdash;she&mdash;well, the foreign
devil,&mdash;should arrive?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think she cannot utterly deceive us both,&quot; said Haganè,
diplomatically.</p>

<p class="indent">Still Onda looked doubtful. &quot;Yesterday I should have
said the same; but since this defiance&mdash;this exhibition of
unwomanly strength&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My life has been one long school of human character.
Yuki will not deceive us both,&quot; reiterated the Prince.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am content. I will now remove my worthless body
from your sight, having claimed already far too much of your
august consideration.&quot; Tetsujo bowed and rose. The other
rose also, following him half across the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is yet one bit of counsel,&quot; said he. &quot;For the next
three days, until the banquet, Yuki must not leave the house
alone. Let her go where she will, Tetsujo, but be you always
near. If a foreigner should force entrance, or stop your
daughter on the street, allow no private speech between them;
and if he persist, as mad foreigners will, call the nearest
guard, and make free use of my name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your mercy is as wide as Heaven, Lord,&quot; murmured the
kerai, as he finally took his departure.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Through the gentle and most willing mediator, Iriya, Tetsujo
transmitted his willingness to receive Yuki&#39;s foreign
friends. This sudden clemency, riding on the very back of
fury, turned to the girl a masked face of new fear. She knew
her father incapable of such sudden reversion, or of the subtlety
implied. A stronger power was behind him. She was
to be watched and experimented upon. Yet, in spite of this
intuitive belief, she could not put aside the opportunity of
seeing her friend, of hearing from her lover.</p>

<p class="indent">A messenger bore her carefully worded note to the American
Legation. Mrs. Todd and Gwendolen responded almost
instantly. The former overwhelmed her with endearments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
and reproaches, an exhibition embarrassing to the girl and
terrifying to Iriya. The servants peeped in through chinks
in the hall shoji, and at this sight Maru clapped a hand to
her mouth to keep from shrieking, and, fleeing to the backyard,
rocked to and fro, sobbing, &quot;The big foreign lady is
eating our young mistress; oh, what terrible creatures are
the foreigners!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Mrs. Todd, happily unconscious of the effect
she was producing, continued her volley of ejaculations.
&quot;My dearest child! <i>Such</i> relief when your note came.
Gwendolen and I were almost distracted, weren&#39;t we, Gwendolen?
Of course Cyrus called us geese, and said we were
making mountains out of mole-hills; but Cy is always disagreeable
when we get into a twitter. But I can assure you,
my dear, there is one man at least who does not think us
silly; he has been worse off than either of us, hasn&#39;t he,
Gwennie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be careful&mdash;be careful,&quot; said Yuki, in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya was in the room, a very figure-head of a hostess with
her reserved, timid ways and lack of fluent English. She
managed now by gestures, and a very careful use of certain
phrases learned by rote from a book of foreign etiquette, to
invite her guests to be seated. When this was accomplished,
not without many suppressed grunts from the stout lady,
Gwendolen managed to get near her friend, and to put out a
cool, slim hand, with a pressure of re-assuring love. Yuki
clasped the hand quickly, but did not forget another warning
look. She leaned next toward the great cluster of hot-house
flowers which the American girl wore at her belt, and, under
cover of examining them, whispered, &quot;My father is already
opposed to me. I do not know what to do. Even writing a
letter is impossible. Only tell him to be patient, and have
faith.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s beside himself,&quot; returned Gwendolen, in the same
suppressed voice. &quot;He carries on like a girl at a matinée;
but this word from you will help him. Of course all of us
knew that something was going wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd, to divert attention from the whisperers, engaged
Iriya in vociferous conversation. &quot;Yuki back again! You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
very happy?&quot; she asked in a loud voice, as if her hostess
were deaf.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; rejoined Iriya, timidly, in English, &quot;we are quite
hap-pee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, she understands beautifully!&quot; cried Mrs. Todd to
the two girls, in triumph, as at a personal achievement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother reads English well, and even in talking she understands
things, when one is thoughtful to speak slowly and
emphatic, as you have done, dear Mrs. Todd. But she is bashful
about the trying,&quot; said Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She needn&#39;t be, I&#39;m sure!&quot; cried the matron. &quot;She pronounces
real well. But it&#39;s a never-ending marvel to me how
these people pick it up. Why, there&#39;s hardly a shop in the
Ginza where they don&#39;t talk it! I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll never catch on
to your queer language, Yuki-ko, if I live here a hundred
years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come look at my dear plum-tree that I used to talk about
in America,&quot; said Yuki to Gwendolen, rising as she spoke.
Iriya looked up in consternation. Her artless face showed
perfectly that she had been forbidden to let Yuki from her
sight. Behind a certain closed fusuma panel, the one opening
directly into Tetsujo&#39;s study, came a very low sound, as if of
a stifled cough. Yuki threw a sad little smile back over her
shoulder to Iriya. &quot;I am not going from the veranda,
mother,&quot; she said in English.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; whispered Gwendolen, as they reached
the further side of the room, &quot;are you a condemned prisoner
already?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Yuki, &quot;but I am a watched one. It is too
humiliating.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are they afraid Pierre will run away with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They know nothing of Pierre, only that I wish to choose
for myself the man I am to marry. They do not even certainly
know that he is a foreigner. I must keep them from
knowing, or they will be more angrier yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father is not exactly a lover of foreigners, is he?&quot;
asked Gwendolen, dryly.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki gave a sorry little smile. &quot;And a Frenchman, Gwendolen,&mdash;a
Frenchman with the Russian mother! It is going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
to be a long, hard fight, like the coming war itself. But I
must be brave. My promise I have given to Pierre.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor darling,&quot; cried Gwendolen, clasping her closer, &quot;I
almost wish you hadn&#39;t; but, of course, when one is in love,&mdash;I
have a letter for you here. Shall you dare take it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki flushed and looked miserable, as she said, &quot;Yes, I shall
take it, though I must use the deceit. I will for the first
time deceive. When we go back, put it on the floor in your
handkerchief, and I will take it up. I feel to be sick at the
thought of such treachery to my parents; but what am I to
do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Neither had much thought for the beautiful plum-tree now
opening optimistic blooms after the storm of yesterday. As
the girls came into the room together, Mrs. Todd said to Yuki,
&quot;Your mother tells me that you are all invited to the banquet
of Prince Haganè for next Friday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Yuki, smiling and seating herself near the
speaker, &quot;we have accepted; but at the last moment mother
will find some good excuse for staying away. She always does.
Is not that true, Mama San?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The substance of the loving gibe being translated, Iriya
blushed and tittered, and put her face to her sleeve, like any
schoolgirl. &quot;Naugh-tee Yuki-ko,&quot; she managed to say, &quot;make
bad talk of Mama San!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the bell of the entrance gate gave a jangle
unusually loud and abrupt. Immediately bare feet of servants
were heard scurrying about the floors of the house.
Iriya drew her head erect to listen. &quot;It is another honorable
visitor,&quot; she murmured, and half arose, sinking back, as she
remembered her husband&#39;s injunction.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s heart had begun to beat. There was something most
un-Japanese in the harsh, sudden clamor of the tiny bell.
Masculine footsteps, unmistakably in foreign shoes, came
around by the kitchen side of the house through rows of green
&quot;na,&quot; and crunched the gravel of the paths. Yuki&#39;s face went
white. This was a breach of etiquette possible only to a
foreigner, and to one newly arrived in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">As the group of four women gazed outward, not knowing
what to expect, Pierre Le Beau&#39;s high-bred, sensitive face, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
little worn by the suspense of the past three days, came around
the corner, and stared at them across the narrow, polished
veranda. Yuki and Iriya were alike incapable of speech.
A sulphurous, low growl was heard behind the fusuma.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shake off your shoes and join us,&quot; came Mrs. Todd&#39;s
loud, jovial command.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Miss Onda repeats the invitation,&quot; said he, with eyes
upon the shrinking girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya bowed without realizing what she did. It was against
all decency for women to receive, alone, a male visitor. She
longed to call her husband, but did not dare. For once in
her courteous, quiet life, Iriya Onda was at a loss what to do.
Yuki made up her mind quickly. Though her heart longed,
burned to have him near, she knew that he must be sent
away. If he came in, Tetsujo would realize instantly who it
was, and would transmit the knowledge to his shrewder and
more far-sighted monitor. She was helpless, alone, unarmed,
but none the less determined to fight the battle of a love to
which she had promised fidelity. With effort she raised
herself to a stiff, upright posture, and, keeping her voice
clear and cold, she said, &quot;Sir, if my honored father were at
home he would doubtless entreat you to enter, but in his
absence, neither my mother nor myself have authority to
take that pleasant duty upon ourselves. If you will pardon
my great rudeness, sir, we shall need to be excused from
receiving you at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant the young man stared. Slowly his face
grew white. He gave one glance of concentrated love, pain,
and resentment, and then passed, without a word, along the
edge of the veranda, and under the out-leaning plum-tree.
Yuki, watching him with a dying heart, felt that never again
could she look upon her favorite tree without seeing that
fair, bowed head beneath the branches. Mrs. Todd gaped,
incredulous, at the girl. Gwendolen alone realized the situation.
She sprang to her feet instantly. &quot;Mother!&quot; she cried,
&quot;the young man came for us, of course. We have trespassed
too long on Mrs. Onda&#39;s hospitality; now let us join our unfortunate
visitor at the gate and have him ride home with us,
I have something of importance to say to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
Yuki gave a little sob of gratitude and relief. Mrs. Todd,
partly comprehending, heaved upward to her feet. &quot;Yes,&quot;
she said to Gwendolen, but with a disapproving glance
poured, full-measure, upon the Japanese girl, &quot;let us ask him
to ride home. The poor fellow looked as if the earth had
crumbled under his feet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki felt the reproach. She could have laughed aloud at
the irony of it.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd walked in what she supposed a stately fashion
across the room. Her feet pressed into the soft matting as
into a stiff dough, leaving behind her a track of shallow
indentations.</p>

<p class="indent">At parting Gwendolen whispered in her friend&#39;s ear, &quot;I
understood. Your father has been watching all along. I
will make things clear to the other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When the panelled gate was closed once more, and the
little bell cold after long reverberation, Yuki felt a great
physical shudder. Her nerves demanded of her the respite
of tears, but still she held herself in check. The luxury of
weeping and the hidden letter alike must wait until a night
hour when the rest of the house was asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">She went out into the sunshine of the garden, well within
sight of the house. She tried not to think, or to allow forebodings.
Against the old plum-tree she leaned, catching idly
the white drifting petals. Each might have been a separate
poem, so freighted is Japanese lore with fancies and exquisite
imagery drawn from this favorite flower. The transience
of life, its sweetness, fidelity to natural law, wifehood and
womanly tenderness, rebirth, immortality,&mdash;all these thoughts
and more came to her softly as the petals came. Through
each mood, like the clang and clash of brass through low
melody, recurred the vision of Pierre&mdash;of his yellow hair
beneath the old plum-tree. But with the petals fell uncounted
moments, heaped less tangibly into hours. So passed
the day and succeeding days.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> short interval between the Todds&#39; visit and Prince
Haganè&#39;s banquet was wrought, within the confines of the
Onda home, of small, shifting particles of disquiet, discontent,
despondency,&mdash;a sort of mist that kept the spirit dark and
chill.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo found difficulty in meeting his daughter&#39;s gaze;
though, when her face was averted, he looked long, and
moodily enough. He had spoken to her more than once,
always in forced, crisp speech, chopping his words into inches
and weighing each separate cube. Through this mechanical
means he informed her that she was to attend Prince Haganè&#39;s
banquet without fail, and ride there in a double jinrikisha with
him, her father. Iriya and the servants were permitted to
resume normal relations with the culprit. Externally things
went into their old domestic grooves.</p>

<p class="indent">It came to the girl, not with a shock of surprise, but rather
as an insidious growth of conviction, that the decision behind
Tetsujo&#39;s demeanor was inspired by no less a person than
Lord Haganè. At first it seemed incredible that so great a man
could concern himself with the affairs of a mere girl. At this
very moment he was in the midst of a threatened national
crisis. Friendship with her father could scarcely account for
all. Haganè must have some personal suspicion of the existence
of Pierre, of Pierre&#39;s family, and of his attitude toward
her. Her mind went back to her meeting with the Prince
in Washington. She had been the one to introduce Pierre.
Now she tried to recall every look and word of that morning
interview, which followed her débutante ball. Again she saw
Haganè&#39;s stern, scarred face, thrilled to the kindness of his
voice as he spoke of her childhood, and pondered anew his
meaning in the final admonition to loyalty. Perhaps even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
then he suspected that she and Pierre were more than friends.
No, she could not believe it! Even if he did suspect, it was
not certain that he would disapprove. Haganè was known
everywhere as a friend to foreigners. He had travelled much,
and had seen with his own eyes the splendor and the opportunities
of foreign courts. He would know that, as wife of a
diplomat, no matter what his country, she could serve her
own.</p>

<p class="indent">At any rate she was soon again to meet the ex-daimyo. She
was glad at least of this, and until she judged for herself,
would not believe absolutely that the great man was against her.
The thought of seeing him, of standing near him, gave her a
sort of gentle strength and calm, as one feels when standing
beside a great tree. If she could only get a warning to her
lover,&mdash;to that less strong but dearly loved Pierre! Toward
him she was beginning to feel, not only a girl&#39;s romantic devotion,
but a mother&#39;s protecting tenderness. Here in her own
country she longed to have her arms around him, shielding and
at the same time preventing him from ignorance and prejudice.
At Haganè&#39;s villa he was possibly to face an ordeal, unwarned
by a hint from her. A little hope crept closer. Pierre was a
passionate admirer of all the arts of Japan, Haganè an untiring
collector. At the Tabata banquet pictures would surely be
displayed. It was possible that Pierre&#39;s intelligence and
appreciation might win him the most powerful of friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the night before the banquet the young girl lay
awake. The faint light of the andon flowed across her, melting
into soft grayness at the far end of the room. It ruled, as
with a heavy pencil, the overlapping boards of the ceiling.
She counted them, but to no purpose. Sleep perched higher.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A flock of sheep that leisurely pass by,&mdash;one after one;
bees murmuring&mdash;&quot; she quoted under her breath, and lay
still as a fallen rose. Sleep grinned down from the small,
high branches of night. She thought of dark running water,
of a green curtain stretched across nothingness, of a deep,
bottomless pool; but sleep, the raven, never stirred a feather.</p>

<p class="indent">Beside her bed, on the soft, matted floor, lay a white prayer-book,
a tiny vase containing a few sprays of umè (plum-flower),
and a chatelaine watch set with pearls. The watch had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
a graduation present from Gwendolen. From time to time
Yuki lifted the animated toy, turned its face toward the andon,
and held it to her ear, only to fall back with a smothered sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will the blessed daylight never come?&quot; thought Yuki for
the hundredth time. Just as she had relinquished all hope of
it, slumber darted down, but in its harsh beak was a dream.</p>

<p class="indent">She wandered, silent, on a great black moor. Near her
feet, as she moved, a dull light flickered, turning all the
dry grass red, and making, as it were, a muffled pathway for
her guidance. She was searching, searching, searching,&mdash;for
what, for whom, she could not recall. Her memory was darkened
like the moor, and its dull flashes showed alike only
empty space. Suddenly, far off to the right, a steadier beacon
sprang. Stars seemed to be climbing up by a stair as yet invisible.
The moor quivered into an even glow,&mdash;a mist rising
as from a sea of blood. Not fifty paces from her eyes stood
Pierre. He smiled, and stretched out his arms to her. The
red glare whitened as it fell on him. Then she knew for what
she had been searching. She would have fled to him, but found
she could not move at all.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of the Eastern light now came armed men, lances, falchions,
spears, all glittering in the unreal glow. She knew it
for a daimyo&#39;s procession. It came forward swiftly to the gap
which held her wide from Pierre. Decked horses, bullock-carts
with huge black-lacquered wheels, and countless warriors, some
mounted, some on foot, must pass her. There was movement
of tramping; the horses reared and struck heavily on the earth,
yet no sound came. Staring at that point from which the
long procession rose, she saw it still curving up from an illimitable
horizon,&mdash;first points of spears and banners; then
heads; then men, horses, chariots,&mdash;an endless chain. She
crouched nearer to the ghosts within her reach, hoping to recognize
a friendly face, or at least a kind one, whom she could
importune to let her through the line. She peered under hoods
and helmets and into the bamboo-blinds of bullock-carts, then
fell to earth with a scream, for the faces were not human;
each was an ape that grinned at her. In Japan no dream is
more prophetic of evil than a dream of apes.</p>

<p class="indent">At the agonized cry Suzumè ran from her room at the far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
side of the house. From the adjoining room came Iriya.
Fusuma were flung wide.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive&mdash;forgive&mdash;my rudeness in honorably disturbing
you at this hour,&quot; gasped the girl. &quot;It was a dream, so terrible
a dream!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, tell it to the nanten-bush, Miss Yuki. There is one
beside your doorstone!&quot; screamed little Maru as she came.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too late!&quot; muttered Suzumè. &quot;Already she has broken
silence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She shivers with fear, poor jewel,&quot; said Iriya, chafing the
icy hands. &quot;Suzumè, if a coal of fire can be found, brew hot
tea for her. That will be best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A coal always sleeps in my ashes,&quot; boasted the nurse. &quot;I
shall at once prepare the drink.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother, you must not remain awake with me at such an
hour,&quot; chattered the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dawn is very near, my child. I hear,&mdash;yes, listen,&mdash;I
hear the first sparrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little friendly sparrow, how I thank you!&quot; cried Yuki,
aloud; then throwing herself into her mother&#39;s arms, she
began to sob.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">That afternoon, when Yuki stepped into the big double
kuruma where Tetsujo was already seated, she had never, in
spite of sleeplessness and bad dreams, looked more beautiful.
Iriya, as her daughter had predicted, found on this last day
many excellent reasons for staying at home.</p>

<p class="indent">The robing of Yuki had occupied several hours. First,
the thick black hair must be done in the latest fashion.
Happily this, ever changing, was for the moment in a style
peculiarly becoming to her. A great wing stood out at each
side, concealing all but the lower tips of the ears. A third
division, puffed high above the forehead, completed a shining
framework to the pale, spiritual face. Among the coils at
the back, a strip of dull pink silk was interwoven,&mdash;a flesh-colored
centre to a great orchid of jet. She wore a single
hairpin, a filigree toy of gold and tinsel representing fireflies
in a tiny cage. Her gray kimono of thin silk showed the
pink undergarment. The delicate hue appeared in puffed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
wadded edges also at throat, wrists, and around the hem.
Cherry-flowers were dyed at intervals into the substance of
the gray. The obi, that crowning glory of a Japanese woman&#39;s
dress, was of blue gray satin, with embroidered fireflies of
gold.</p>

<p class="indent">Even surly Tetsujo smiled as this fair vision stood upon
the doorstone. Little Maru set the high lacquered clogs
with pink velvet thongs in readiness. Iriya held out the
long black adzuma-coat, while old Suzumè shook odors of
incense and sandalwood from the crêpe folds of the head-kerchief
called &quot;dzukin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sayonara danna san! (master!) Sayonara o jo san!&quot; called
the three women on their knees in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sayonara, arigato gozaimasu!&quot; (I thank you!) cried Yuki
in return, waving a slender hand from the side of the jinrikisha.
Tetsujo seemed not to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">The unusual proximity brought to the girl, and, as she
justly surmised, to Tetsujo also, an unwholesome embarrassment.
Each met the difficulty in a characteristic way,&mdash;Yuki
by throwing her full interest into flashing street scenes about
her; Tetsujo by a morose withdrawal into his feudal shell.
Twice Yuki spoke concerning some sight that gave her
pleasure. Her father&#39;s discouraging reply, in both cases, was
a grunt. On the slope of Tabata he got out, shook himself
like a great dog, and sent Yuki on in the jinrikisha until
level land was reached. The girl thought sadly of another
hill-ascent, so short a time before; of Tetsujo&#39;s kind, loving
face as he mounted the slope of Kobinata, his hand on the
arm of her little vehicle, his eyes free to her own. Now she
was being carried by this same father before a judge, before
a man who could help to rule his empire, and yet who, if her
fears proved stable, now stooped to coerce a wilful girl.</p>

<p class="indent">The entrance gate and court of the Tabata villa had taken
on, strangely, the look of its master. The gate was of
unpolished cedar, studded with brass nails half a foot across,
and barred with hinges that might have swung a hill. The
massive panels now stood hospitably ajar. Above them
leaned a single pine, red-stemmed and tall, of the indigenous
Japanese variety. It, too, resembled Haganè. The house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
beyond was but little larger or more pretentious than that of
Onda the kerai; but the variety of woods used in finishing
bespoke both taste and great wealth. The roof, with its dark-blue
scalloped tiling was edged at the rim with flattened discs
of baked clay, and in the centre of each, in rough intaglio,
curved the crest of the Haganè clan.</p>

<p class="indent">Sombre shoji opened, before the visitors had time to dismount.
Just within, a superb suitatè, or single screen of
gold, painted in snow-laden bamboo trees, shut out interior
vistas. Yuki was conducted to a woman&#39;s apartment, where
she could remove her wraps and examine her shining blue-black
coiffure for a misplaced hair. Tetsujo strode to the
guest-room. At sight of Prince Haganè seated, still alone,
he gave a great sigh of relief. Haganè turned with a smile,&mdash;&quot;You
love not our foreign friends, good Tetsujo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love them as our cat loves pickled plums, my liege.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè laughed indulgently. &quot;At least you can distinguish
the men from the women,&mdash;be sure to give me the signal
should one of the young males prove to be he who was with
Yuki on the hatoba, and who so rudely forced an entrance to
your premises.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not forget,&quot; said Tetsujo.</p>

<p class="indent">The wide room was unchanged but for an unusually elaborate
flower-composition in the tokonoma (recess). A most
valuable set of pictures, three in number, and all mounted
alike on priceless brocade, filled the soft, gray tinted space
beyond the flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki entered alone. Neither of the men had heard her soft
stockinged step, nor her gentle pushing aside of a golden
fusuma.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go kigen (august health), your Highness,&quot; she murmured,
sinking where she stood and touching her forehead to the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, it is Yuki-ko. Come nearer, child,&quot; said the host,
kindly. As she moved toward him, his eyes rested with frank
delight on the vision of her beauty. &quot;You are now truly a
maiden of Japan. That last image of you in Washington, if I
remember rightly, was of a small brown wren of Paris.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So at the time you observed, Augustness, and my spirit
thereat was poisoned by deep shame.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
&quot;A thing so easily rectified can scarcely be a cause of
shame,&quot; smiled Haganè. &quot;You are now as truly Japanese
as even your jealous father could desire. Will you kindly
clap and serve us tea, small pigeon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki obeyed instantly and in silence. She was glad to
have some occupation for her hands, glad that her eyes had
good excuse for drooping. In Prince Haganè&#39;s presence the
old magnetism, the old troubled sense of his power, again
possessed her. Compared with him, nothing else seemed
real. He established new values for the spirit. One in the
room with him needed no vision to certify his actual place.
He dominated and charged the air around him. She felt his
eyes as they rested on her slim white hands; she knew when
that gaze was turned away.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè, indeed, looked long at the girl. At times he appeared
to study her with a gentle, speculative gravity. Of
her beauty there had never been a doubt, and to-day she
looked her best. Haganè&#39;s experience of women had been
wide. Now he was saying to himself that this was the fairest
maiden of the whole world. Her beauty filled the room like
perfume. An old Chinese poet in singing of her would have
called her &quot;a flake of white jade held against a star.&quot; In the
statesman&#39;s mind fragments of poetry flitted, similes of moon-light,
of white blossoms newly opened in the dew, of hillside
grasses in the wind, of a young spring willow with a nightingale
in the branches. Poetry is as natural to all classes of
Japanese as profanity to the average sailor. Haganè gained
new delight in imagery. Should a foreigner be allowed to
bear away the sweetness of this flower? No; Tetsujo was
justified in his indignation. No foreigner should have her.
She must marry some young nobleman of her own land; some
honorable and brilliant youth with a future, and at least a hint
of personal beauty to match her own. Haganè&#39;s mind ran
rapidly through a list of eligible men. Objections rose at
every point. One was of poor health, another lived a life of
open immorality, a third possessed a mother of uncertain
temper; Yuki-ko must not have her young life crushed by the
tyranny of a shrewish mother-in-law. She should by right be
married to a statesman, and be mistress at once of an official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
home. In this way would her beauty and foreign education be
brought into immediate service. If he himself were a young
man, what rapture to have that living thing, made up of dew
and morning, entirely one&#39;s own! Haganè drew a single sharp
breath and was calm.</p>

<p class="indent">On the gravelled walk of the entrance court came the sound
of a carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His Excellency Mister Todd-u, Madame Todd-u, Mees
Todd-u, Mister Douje, and Mister Le Beau,&quot; announced a
servant in what he thought English.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè went forward to meet them. &quot;Welcome to my
cottage. Are we all known, one to the other?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your Highness,&quot; answered Mr. Todd, &quot;unless Mr.
Le Beau here is the exception.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mister Le Beau,&quot; repeated Haganè, very distinctly. &quot;I
remember with much clearness the meeting with Mister Le
Beau. In your admirable dwelling in the capital city of
Washington that meeting took place. Yuki&mdash;Miss Onda&mdash;performed
the introduction ceremony. I remember well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I, your Highness,&quot; instantly answered Pierre, with a
succession of the sprightly bows that had so incensed old Onda.
&quot;It is to be supposed that I should bear in memory so great
an event; but I could not have dared to hope for so great a
condescension from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè replied by a smile and a nod. The latter might
have served equally for the kerai who, well within the shadow
of Mrs. Todd, made vehement signs of corroboration to his
daimyo.</p>

<p class="indent">The host then asked of the party, &quot;Shall I not order for
you foreign chairs? We keep them in the storehouse for
such occasions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you kindly, Prince,&quot; answered Mrs. Todd for all;
&quot;we&#39;ll take the floor. In Rome we do as the Romans do.&quot;
With a lunge the good lady disposed herself in the centre of
the apartment, sitting, as it were, at her own feet. The others
placed themselves near her, making roughly the outline of a
horseshoe, Dodge being at one end, with Yuki beside him, and
Prince Haganè at the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen had with difficulty kept Pierre away from Yuki.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
&quot;Remember,&quot; she had warned, &quot;this may be a sort of Sherlock
Holmes affair for making you two betray yourselves and
each other. You can&#39;t be too careful. Old Haganè is a vibrating
lodestone of uncanny intuition, and Onda a parental avalanche
just ready to slide!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the effort to keep his hungry eyes from Yuki, Pierre
began to explore the room. His attention was first caught by
the arrangement of dwarf pine branches and brown cones, in
combination with straggling sprays of a yellow orchid. Then
he saw the three paintings beyond. &quot;Saint Raphael! what
are those?&quot; he murmured under his breath, and made as if to
rise from the floor. All turned to him; he sought only the
eyes of his host. &quot;Your Highness,&quot; he pleaded, his face
vital with intelligence, &quot;if not unpardonably rude, may I rise
and examine more closely those marvellous paintings?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè reflected a hint of his brightness. &quot;With greatest
pleasure. They are, of course, hung to be seen. I am honored
that they attract your notice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre rushed to the tokonoma, taking instinctively the
attitudes of a self-forgetting connoisseur.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, I can&#39;t stay out of this!&quot; cried the minister, and crooked
his long legs into the angles of a katydid in his efforts to rise.
Following the two others, he reached the tokonoma, planting
himself, feet wide apart, exactly in front.</p>

<p class="indent">Such pictures, painted in sets of three and mounted in
single, flexible panels of rich brocade, were designed for hanging
in the broad tokonoma of noblemen&#39;s houses, or in the
living-rooms of priests. This set was in monochrome, on
paper which had been stained by time to the color of old
ivory. The central painting represented a famous Chinese
poet sitting in meditation upon a misty mountain-ledge. The
lateral ones were landscapes, one of winter snow, the other,
summer fulness. Each illustrated a well-known verse of the
poet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So this is Japanese art,&mdash;the real thing,&mdash;is it?&quot; asked
Mr. Todd of Pierre. &quot;You must excuse me, Prince,&quot; he went
on to his host, &quot;Pierre is always reading and talking about
the beauty of it, but I&#39;ll be gosh&mdash;I&#39;ll be shot, I mean,&mdash;if
I can tell what it is about. Over in my own country, now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
I can distinguish a tree from a vase of Johnny-jump-ups, and
a farmyard from a nood female; but with these pictures,
somehow, the harder I look the more I seem to be standing on
my head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cy, I am ashamed of you! <i>I</i> love Japanese art, your
Highness, and so does my daughter!&quot; expostulated Mrs. Todd,
from the floor. &quot;It is so nice, and thin, and cool. I always
recommend Japanese pictures to my friends for their summer
cottages, and I am hanging our Legation with them now.
Dear Mrs. Y., of Washington,&mdash;you know the name, of course,&mdash;has
the most gorgeous screen of gold-leaf, painted in wildflowers.
When she has a big reception she always puts it
upside down behind her sofa, because it has more flowers at
the bottom than at the top,&mdash;and nobody ever notices the
difference.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young Frenchman&#39;s cheek flushed. He leaned more
closely to the paintings, partly to hide his expression. Gwendolen
exchanged horrified glances with Dodge, then the sense
of fun in both triumphed. Pierre spoke next in low tones, so
that none but Haganè could hear him. &quot;I am only a beginner,&mdash;a
student. There has been little published in foreign
languages about your wonderful art, and European collections
are rare. Am I wrong in thinking these to be something
unusual? The lines of the three flow together like music,
yet each is a separate composition. <i>We</i> have nothing like it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are masterpieces by Kano Motonobu,&quot; said Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; breathed Pierre, and seemed as if he would
devour with new scrutiny the marvellous visions.</p>

<p class="indent">The host&#39;s eyes remained fastened upon his enthusiastic
guest. He watched every flicker of intelligence, of changing
expression. Suddenly the young man turned, met the look,
and smiled. It was like sunlight on a meadow when Pierre
smiled. &quot;Your Highness,&quot; he murmured, &quot;a touch of art
should make the whole world kin! Is it not so? Teach me
something more of this new mystery of beauty,&mdash;be my
friend!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè lowered his lids quickly, but in the downward sweep
he caught a glimpse of Yuki&#39;s eager, upturned face. She had
forgotten herself and her immediate companions. Her spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
had crept over to the strangely mated two who stood before
the pictures.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur honors me by offering such a privilege,&quot; said
Haganè, in an expressionless tone. He bowed slightly. Pierre
drew back, feeling unaccountably rebuffed. Why had the
great man said &quot;Monsieur&quot;? Before that, the plain term
&quot;Mister&quot; had been employed. Vanity, never very far from
the citadel of Pierre&#39;s being, posited an explanation. &quot;He
calls you by the French title,&quot; said Vanity, &quot;because he
realizes that no Occidental of another country than France
could show such appreciation.&quot; Pierre recalled the awful remarks
of Todd, the deeper idiocy of his complacent lady.
&quot;Yes, that is it,&quot; said Pierre to Vanity.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè had now re-seated himself. He was a few yards
directly across from Dodge and Yuki. He studied furtively
the countenance of Dodge. With this regard he was quickly
satisfied. The American&#39;s clear brown eyes were as free from
guile as those of a setter pup. He turned again to Pierre, who
had now thrown himself, in a graceful attitude of lounging,
beside fair Gwendolen. Gwendolen deflected the glance from
her companion. Her merry hazel eyes dwelt with bright
friendliness and an utter absence of awe upon the titled host.
For the first time Haganè noticed her, looked directly at her,
perceived in her something a little more than blown golden
hair and girlish audacity. Something in her gaze gave him
an impression of pliant boughs, elastic yet imperishable. This
trained commander seldom failed to recognize the intangible,
unmistakable flash of the thing we call, for a better name,
character. Something in answer to it, a salute of his own
brave spirit, rose to the deep eyes. A little thrill passed over
Gwendolen. &quot;Gracious!&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;That&#39;s
no mere war-engine, that&#39;s a man, and a great one!&quot; To
cover her vague embarrassment she leaned to him, letting
coquetry blot the real from her face, and pleaded, &quot;Show us
some more pictures, please, your Highness. I hear that you
have storehouses crammed with them. Even I, in spite of what
mother says, appreciate those in the tokonoma. <i>Please!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè bowed unsmiling. The mere dainty allurements of
a pretty girl seemed to him almost an affront, as if his old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
nurse should give him a kite to fly, or a top to spin. He fell
into thought. After a moment&#39;s somewhat uncomfortable
silence he said slowly, &quot;There is one painting I should like
to show this honorable group of friends; but first its strange
history must be told, and I fear that I have not the fluent
English.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, we simply must have the story! Your English is all
right, Prince; I&#39;ll declare it is. Please tell us,&quot; cried Gwendolen
the irrepressible, and she moved a few inches closer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your Highness, your English is wonderful. You
don&#39;t make half the grammatical mistakes that I do now!&quot;
supplemented Mrs. Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè drew a slow glance around the semicircle, plunged
his hands within his silken sleeves, and began to speak. His
voice was very deep, and in some consonant sounds, of a slight
harshness. The vowels were full, rich, and resonant. His
speech held at command a certain strange, almost benumbing
magnetism, a compelling response, such as one experiences in
the after-vibrations of a great bell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I feel in my bones that it is going to be a ghost story,
a real one,&quot; whispered Gwendolen, with a shiver of excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè did not notice the remark. Todd and Mr. Dodge
sent her, in unison, a bright glance of appreciation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The painting for which I now attempt the speaking,&quot; said
Haganè, &quot;made, for centuries, the chief altarpiece of a certain
old temple in Yamato. It was a very old temple,&mdash;yes,
among the very first built in Nippon for Buddhist worship.
One night, when the black sky was rent with storm, and lightning
hurled out many terrible spears, one flash found that
temple, burning it swiftly to a square of low red ashes. Everything
burned; gold and brass and iron melted like wax&mdash;all
but the picture; and three days after they found it still on
red coals, glowing more fierce and red than they. Nothing
was harmed in it except the brocaded edge, and that was soon
replaced. This is the picture you shall see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; breathed Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afterward it was conveyed to a famous temple of Kioto;
but the head priest, the Ajari, being of timid thought, refused
to shelter it. By his order it was carried in secrecy to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
a much smaller temple, very distant, in the province of Konda,
where is my father&#39;s home of birth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paused. The listeners all shifted position a little, all
but Yuki, who sat upright and motionless, her soul living in
her long dark eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Even in so small a temple its power began to attract many
worshippers and wonder-seekers. The fame of it grew like
the grasses of summer. At the time of our Restoration, the
beginning of that cycle of our time called &#39;Mei-ji,&#39; its destruction
was officially decreed. It was designated &#39;the object of
slavish superstition.&#39; My father was requested, with his own
hands, to annihilate it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; muttered Pierre, with feeling. &quot;But, thank the
good God, it wasn&#39;t destroyed, since you are soon to show
it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One of Mrs. Todd&#39;s thick feet had gone to sleep. She
stretched it out under her skirt with great caution.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè looked up into Pierre&#39;s bright eyes. &quot;As you
observe, Monsieur, it was not annihilated. My father made
request of Government that it be sold privately to him,
and in return he gave pledge that it never again be used&mdash;publicly&mdash;as
the altarpiece. Thus it came into my possession.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There had been something suggestive, almost sinister, in
his use of the word &quot;publicly.&quot; His glance had just brushed
Yuki&#39;s face. Gwendolen&#39;s hands turned cold. &quot;But what
power needed to be suppressed&mdash;what harm could a picture
do?&quot; cried the blonde girl, eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">Before attempting an answer, Haganè clapped for a servant,
and, with a few low words, sent him off for the picture. He
turned, looking first at Gwendolen, then at Yuki. &quot;It is a
painting of the Red God, Aizen Bosatsu. It was prayed to,
and sacrificed to by men and women who loved. Generally
they were persons who wished to become the man and wife
against the wishes of parents and guardians; less often, of some
guilty one already married, and wishing an impure love. Its
strange power is this,&mdash;that one consumed with passion, making
offerings, passing long nights in prayer, and crying forth
incessantly desperate invocation, may see the red flesh and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
crimson lotos petals fall away like shrivelled bark, revealing
the white and shining face of Kwannon the Merciful. This is
the reward of those who pray for the strength to be loyal,
who wish, in their deeper essence, the ultimate Good. But the
painting has another&mdash;and more awful power&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, Lord,&quot; whispered Yuki, speaking now for the
first time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Should the mad soul clamor on for earthly desire, ignoring
what is high,&mdash;then will the Red God burn, burn, burn,
even as the heated heart of evil passion burns; and the
power of that suppliant to do evil will be strengthened.
Circumstances may be compelled, and the wish, however
harmful, be attained. With each new triumph of a soul, the
merit of the picture deepens; with each malefic use, the evil
grows more strong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, Lord, would be the penalty&mdash;what to a wicked
soul would be the price?&quot; asked Yuki&#39;s bloodless lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your early training was Buddhistic, child,&quot; answered
Haganè, in the gentlest of voices. &quot;You know the doctrine
of rebirth! Instinct tells you the price already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo had withdrawn his eyes from their fierce contemplation
of his daughter, as if the sight continually fed his
anger. He rocked now, with downcast eyes and folded
arms, on his cushion, ignoring everything but his own black
thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen tried in vain to catch Yuki&#39;s eye. She saw that
already Yuki was betraying what Haganè and old Onda
wished to know. The moment was fatal and memorable.</p>

<p class="indent">The servant now returned, bearing a long box of dull red
lacquer. Yuki shivered so that all saw her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Examine the quaint carvings of devils, Monsieur,&quot; said
Haganè to Pierre, with light affability. As Pierre leaned to
take the box, Yuki gave an imperceptible start forward, caught
her breath, and then resumed self-control.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gems, all of them!&quot; cried Pierre, in impersonal delight.
&quot;They are unbelievable in cleverness. Each seems an evil
passion caught in fleeting human form.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur is intuitive. They are hungry spirits of the
Gaki underworld, creatures of ever aching, ever unsatisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
desires. The Hindoo scriptures call them &#39;preta.&#39; Perhaps
you Christians have not such uncomfortable passions, ne?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen had another shock to receive. In this new
light, flashed past before one realized its presence, Haganè
showed to her the eyes of a demon, a creature of power and of
passion. She recoiled from him as from the supernatural.
The new discomfort was vented on the box. &quot;Let us have
the picture, Prince, or I&#39;ll go wild. Please, somebody sit on
that box,&mdash;the squirming devils give me a waking nightmare.
Why did anybody want to carve such things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè smiled a very quiet smile, just on the borderland
between his demon and his statesman&#39;s self. Yuki, too,
watched him, with an intensity of which she was not aware.
Slowly he lifted the lid of the box, and took out a long
cylindrical roll wrapped in some faded stuff that exhaled
a strange, stifling perfume, as of old shrines. Then he rose,
with his usual dignified, deliberate motions. The servant,
who had been waiting, handed him a small wand tipped
with a claw of ivory, such as is used everywhere in Japan
for hanging kakèmono. Passing the cord over a brass stud
on the wall, he leaned over and downward, unrolling the
painting by slow inches.</p>

<p class="indent">At first nothing appeared but a groundwork of dark silk,
a surface crackled and blackened as by heat and time. A
pointed, thin flame first arose, then a fiery crown of filigree
work that hid suggestions of strange animal forms, then a
staring countenance of an archaic, Hindoo type, provocative,
menacing, appalling! Shoulders rose, swathed thick in
springing flame; a body hung with jewels of red gold; arms
bended at the elbow, crossed legs just visible through drapery,
and lastly the incandescent throne of a vermilion lotos. The
thing glowed wet and fresh, like new-spilled blood. Before its
artistic wonder was the wonder of vitality, for the image
lived,&mdash;not in a world of heavy human flesh, nor yet in
realms ethereal, but in some raging holocaust where the two
worlds chafe and meet. One flaming hand grasped a bunch
of golden arrows; from the other depended coils of gold and
orange rope. Each petal of the lotos throne stood sharp and
clear in an outline of hot gold, and the long, parallel veinings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
were of copper. In a room suddenly darkened it should
spring out in illumination of its own. A scorching breath
blew from it. The leer on the god&#39;s face deepened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ugh!&quot; shuddered Mrs. Todd. She tried to check the
exclamation, and apparently none but Dodge, who sat beside
her, heard the cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be careful,&quot; whispered Dodge. &quot;He does not tell you
half. Men have fought and died for that painting. It is
one of the famous things of Japan, and almost impossible
to see. He surely has a reason in this display.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki and Gwendolen were equally still and voiceless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother of God!&quot; Pierre ejaculated, ignoring ceremony,
and running to the place where the painting, now in full
length, hung. &quot;What a masterpiece! What torment of
genius! There is passion in the very curves of the petals,&mdash;how
they answer the lines of drapery, even the lines of his
ugly face! The flaming halo repeats it like a fugue. Mon
Dieu! One scarcely can endure such supreme beauty.&quot; His
voice broke. He turned away. Haganè watched him curiously.
&quot;Your Highness,&quot; said he, after a very brief interval,
and now with frank, tear-bright eyes on the prince, &quot;I know
not the morality of it, but I, for one, would not be willing
to pray in such fashion that this superb and glorious monster
should fade to a silly white. Rather would I add fury to him,
and evil,&mdash;if that would keep his flame inspired!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Abruptly Haganè turned his face to Yuki. For some
moments past he had ignored her. She had no time to struggle
for self-control. Her thought lay beached on the ashen
face. The two eyes met. In an instant, as if weary, Haganè
turned away, and, crossing the room, seated himself near Onda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we proceed to serve the food, your Highness?&quot;
asked another servant, on his knees, in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, at once. First roll the picture up, and remove it to
the kura.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The banquet was in pure Japanese fashion. The entertainment
began with the usual foolish mistakes on the part of
the foreigners. Yuki was last of all to drift back into the
world of the commonplace; Pierre, of the party, being in highest
spirits. Everything delighted him,&mdash;the food, the trays,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
the little &quot;ne-san&quot; hired for the occasion to pour sakè, the
sakè itself, the sakè bottles,&mdash;all! Recklessly now, he forced
a position beside Yuki, taking her unresponsiveness as part
of the decorum expected of a young girl in Japan. Haganè
showed him special favor, plying him with wine, and exchanging
numberless tiny cups, each one a step, for Pierre, into
further indiscretion. Yuki felt hope slowly die within her.
She saw beyond doubt that Haganè was against Pierre and
with her father. She knew that she had been chief factor in
the betrayal of their love. For a moment she hated, she even
despised a little, the man she had been taught to look on as
a god.</p>

<p class="indent">Never had a sweeter sound come to her ears than Mrs.
Todd&#39;s loud command, &quot;Well, Cy, if we are to go at all, we
had better start. This sakè is beginning to do queer things
to my legs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the farewell ceremonies on the doorstep, Haganè managed
to whisper to his kerai, &quot;Watch her closely. Let her
not leave your sight until you have heard again from me.
There is instant danger!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Prosper Ronsard</span>, the French minister to Tokio, had
formed very early in life the ambition to be a Far Eastern
diplomat. His way to the goal was made in regular steps of
enjoyment. First there had been Morocco, scarcely more to
him now than a far-off memory of yellow sands and white
cubes of houses, both emphasized, at effective intervals, by
theatrical groups of palms. Then came Cairo,&mdash;gay entrancing
Cairo! His life there held experiences that old age
might lick its chops over. Leaving all else aside, the one
flame-tree near his hotel window in Cairo would have burned
that memory deep. Then there were French Siam, Tonquin,
Nagasaki, and, at last, Tokio.</p>

<p class="indent">The hot blood of the East flowed now, as native, in Ronsard&#39;s
veins; but the keen, calculating, questioning judgment
of the European statesman kept cool tenure of his brain. In
Tokio he found all past Eastern trickery to be useless chaff.
Here were no inferior Orientals to browbeat, threaten, or cajole.
From Tonquin to Nagasaki he had crossed more than the
Yellow Sea; he had sailed over three submerged centuries
and landed on a green cliff. Here, in Japan, were men with
reasons as clear as his own, and methods that often proved
themselves more effective. In the mission to Tokio he soon
realized that his full ambition had been won. Every faculty,
trained through long apprenticeship, was here needed; and
it was part of his intelligence that at times he realized them
all as insufficient. That span of &quot;Mysterious Asia&quot; stretched
between Algiers and Tonquin, brilliant and pleasurable indeed,
was, from the diplomatic standpoint, a mere dank subway
coming up at the central station, Tokio.</p>

<p class="indent">The fascinations of the East, potent as they were, could not
quite wean the Parisian from love of his native home. Visits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
to France were made with strict regularity. It was his wont
to declare, and with much show of verity, that the perpetual
resident of Paris could never know its real charm. To live
there always, paying bills, meeting disappointments, enduring
illnesses with the inartistic accompaniments of medicine boxes
and physicians, was like having an inexhaustible supply of
one&#39;s favorite vintage kept in a water-cooler on the back gallery.
Ronsard had the true sensualist&#39;s gift of extracting
flavors.</p>

<p class="indent">On these home visits he was eagerly sought after by his
friends and club fellows, and by the more intelligent among
fashionable women. In this latter category shone pre-eminent
the widowed Princess Olga Le Beau. Rumor often had it
that his next return to the East would be brightened by the
wedded companionship of this lady, but each time Rumor hid
her face.</p>

<p class="indent">The princess had married while yet a schoolgirl. Pierre,
her only child, was born within the year of the marriage.
Before the boy was ten, his father, Gaston Le Beau, died by
accident. Slander called it suicide, and hinted that the princess
was the cause. Nothing, however, could have been more
decorous or more becoming than the mourning of the princess.
As slowly she came back to the world of fashion, Pierre was
sent away to England to be educated. A growing stripling
of a boy is a fatal gauge to his mother&#39;s waning youth. He
was seldom pressed to come home during the holidays, Princess
Olga preferring to visit him in England (a country which
she loathed), or sometimes to take small tours with him
through infrequented parts of Europe.</p>

<p class="indent">After his very creditable career at an English university,
she urged him tenderly further to improve his mind by
travel, and hinted that she would prefer a diplomatic career
for him. As she spoke, she was thinking of Ronsard, but
doubtless had her reasons for not mentioning him. It was
not until the young man&#39;s year of residence in America, and
his own choice of Tokio as a place at which to open his diplomatic
primer, that the power of this intimate family friend
had been invoked. As we have seen, Princess Olga gave the
name, by letter, to her son. Pierre wrote promptly, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
hastened departure of the Todds, and his determination to
sail with them and Yuki, would have given him no time to
receive a long and thoughtful answer, even had such been
written.</p>

<p class="indent">Count Ronsard&#39;s motto, more or less rigidly adhered to in
dealings with his own sex, was &quot;never to write a letter or to
destroy one.&quot; Knowing that the young man was soon to appear,
he calmly waited the event. In official life the French
minister was, of course, designated by the simple republican
title of &quot;Monsieur.&quot; With his friends, the old aristocratic
&quot;Count&quot; was permitted and enjoyed. To have slipped Pierre
into a second, third, or fourth secretaryship would have been a
simple matter. Count Ronsard, however, wisely determined
to judge the character of the applicant before admitting him
into the bachelor comradeship of the Legation. This square
white residence, set in the midst of a fine, walled, daimyo garden
left over from feudal days, had never, during the count&#39;s
long term of service, known feminine sway. High orgies,
balls, and state dinners were held there in plenty, but the
only women who appeared at them were invited guests or
hired geisha. The master of the house carried his bachelor
fancy so far that he insisted upon a similar undetached state
being preserved by his subordinates.</p>

<p class="indent">Count Ronsard was a dilettante in music and art, and a professional
lover of beauty, especially in the form presented by
his friend and countryman, Bouguereau. His favorite writer
was Daudet; his favorite luxury, eating. Withal, he was a
trained statesman and a subtle diplomat.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, upon his arrival in Tokio, had been urged to make
the Legation his temporary home. His first question was,
of course, for the appointment. Count Ronsard gave evasive
reply. As this continued to be the case, Pierre felt, in decency,
that he must cease to press the matter. As days
passed, and the count, so indulgent, fatherly, and candid in
other things, continued to avoid the discussion of Pierre&#39;s
hopes, the young man could not fail to draw the conclusion
that the elder had his personal reasons for not wishing to
come to a decision. Pierre did not greatly care. The anxiety
about Yuki kept his thoughts busy. More than once he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
been on the point of confiding in Count Ronsard and of asking
advice, but each time something prevented. Mrs. Todd,
in this stress, was his unfailing sympathizer. Gwendolen was
kind, but he knew well that there was now, and always had
been, a certain reserve in her approbation of his love-affair.
The laxity of hours at the French Legation, and the absence
of all restrictions, suited well the boy&#39;s present restless
temper.</p>

<p class="indent">The morning after Prince Haganè&#39;s banquet he woke to a
feeling of heaviness and depression that sakè could not altogether
account for. Small bits of recollection began to sting
him like brier-points left under the skin. He saw now, in
Yuki&#39;s white face, a protest which, twelve hours before, he
had wilfully ignored. Gwendolen&#39;s eyes flashed again indignant
warning. The extreme attentiveness of the host, a
lurid after-image of the pictured god, the innumerable small
cups that, at the time, had seemed innocuous, came over him in
humiliating memories. &quot;Gwendolen was right. It was all a
test, and I, as usual, played the impulsive fool!&quot; thought he,
bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching the breakfast-room he was pleasantly surprised
to find his host still at table. A heap of letters, opened and
unopened, showed the cause of delay. Several with foreign
postmarks were at Pierre&#39;s plate. As the young man entered,
Ronsard touched an electric button, giving four short, peculiar
rings. A few seconds later a servant appeared with a tray of
steaming coffee and food.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What news from war-centres, your Excellency?&quot; was
Pierre&#39;s perfunctory question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mon Dieu, war is surely coming! We are upon the very
verge, though our friends the Russians pretend not to believe.
Kurino is to abandon St. Petersburg. I still have a
gleam of hope that the Japanese will have common intelligence,
and withdraw.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Kurino leaves, then the Russian minister here must
withdraw. I was told yesterday that he too made preparations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Each move may be a feint. Diplomacy is largely made
up of feints.&quot; Here he gave a fleshy shrug. &quot;But, my young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
friend, our speculations will not change events. As the Japanese
say, &#39;Shi-ka-ta ga nai,&#39; which, being interpreted, means,
&#39;Way out, there is none.&#39; Tell me of yourself. You are pale.
Do the joys of Tokio prove too arduous?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The speaker, lolling back in his leathern chair, lighted
another cigarette, his eighth since breakfast, and turned an
inquiring leer upon his companion. Pierre was staring into
the smoky coal fire. He had scarcely heard Ronsard&#39;s last
words. Yet all at once he felt that here was an opportunity
to ask the advice he had been craving.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Last night I was at a Japanese banquet, an affair splendid,
but small, given to the family of the newly presented American
minister, Mr. Todd, by Prince Haganè,&quot; he began.</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard showed unmistakable interest. &quot;Ah, the prince!
The old toad who sits at the heart of empire in Japan. And
at his private villa! You are fortunate, Monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you said a family affair. I hear there is a Miss
Todd. Am I to understand that you and the charming
Mademoiselle&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre gave a gesture. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;not she,&mdash;though
the charm is unquestioned. Mr. Dodge and I were included
because of being ship-comrades with the Todd party. There
were also present Miss Onda and her father. Miss Onda was
on the ship with us. She was educated in Washington. I
knew her there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; murmured the other, more thoughtfully. &quot;Rumors
of Miss Onda&#39;s great beauty are already abroad. They will
contemplate an official marriage for her with some fortunate
heathen, honored in his own land. Cela!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will marry no Japanese,&quot; said Pierre, quickly. He
felt Ronsard&#39;s upward look, but did not meet it. His heart
moved a little faster. This was his first bold step upon a
bridge too narrow for turning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; murmured Ronsard again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; repeated Pierre, &quot;she will marry no Japanese. I&mdash;I&mdash;am
in a position to know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is already betrothed, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
&quot;And not to a Japanese?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To an American, I presume. You say she has been educated
in that country. <i>Educated!</i> And in America! The
thought is droll.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not to an American either, your Excellency. To one of
your own race,&mdash;to a Frenchman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Ronsard. It was wonderful what expression
he could cram into that small, elastic sound. Evidently the
intonation on this occasion was far from pleasing to the
listener. Pierre&#39;s blue eyes flashed and darkened. Fixing
them for the first time steadily on his companion he said,
&quot;She is betrothed, your Excellency, to me. Do I receive your
felicitations?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His look was a challenge. Ronsard passed a fat hand over
his mouth before asking, &quot;With her family&#39;s consent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet. Our betrothal was in Washington, shortly before
sailing, and entered into with the full knowledge and consent
of her intimate friends, the Todds. As to the Japanese
father&#39;s consent, we had planned and hoped to gain it immediately
upon reaching Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard&#39;s thin eyebrows arched to the very roots of his
thin, gray hair. &quot;You have arrived,&mdash;two weeks, is it not?
You have not gained?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Things went wrong with me from the instant of landing,&quot;
said Pierre, dejectedly. &quot;I offended in some unknown way
that grim image she calls her parent. I do not know yet in
what I did wrong; but he keeps us apart, and prevents her
even from writing an explanation. The Todds have seen her
but once, and learned only the bald fact of her father&#39;s opposition.
At the banquet last night we both seemed under
espionage,&mdash;subjects for dissection, in fact. I am bewildered
with the misery of it, your Excellency, for I love the girl.
My one hope is that I have her promise, and on her loyalty
alone I must now rely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Count Ronsard drew a long, long whiff from his cigarette,
and then ostentatiously flipped the ash in air. It dissolved
before reaching the floor, a vague little puff of gray nothingness.
&quot;That is what the Japanese think of such a promise!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
The true Jehovah in Japan is the composite will of the family.
Is it not partly so in France, Monsieur? If you really desired
marriage with this bit of ivory, and&mdash;pardon me&mdash;so harsh
a yoke seems utterly unnecessary, you should have persuaded
your inamorata to become a Christian, and, while still in
America, have consummated a Christian marriage. Even a
Japanese, in these enlightened days, would not dare to attack
such a bond.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is a Christian already,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;And for an
American marriage I pleaded with a scourged soul. Even
Madame Todd advised it; but Yuki-ko would not listen. She
must wait, she said, for her family&#39;s consent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very proper of Mademoiselle,&quot; said Ronsard, gravely. As
Pierre made no immediate reply, the count went on with his
theme, &quot;The Japanese family, my son, is like a large web, or
a small solar system. In the midst, as a central sun, or
reptile, squats the father. Behind him is the mystery and
power of <i>his</i> father, living or dead, and his father&#39;s father,
back to the visionary era of Jimmu Tenno. All about him, as
planets, or flies, are dotted the children, the wife, grandparents,
uncles, aunts, cousins to the tenth branch, the family
servants and their connections, the family cat, the family
dog, the family ghost, the priests, soothsayers, physicians,&mdash;Mon
Dieu, down to the very crickets who chirp beneath the
family doorstone. In a question of marriage, all these must
be consulted. The bride is no more than a gnat caught
somewhere in the web, or a very small satellite belonging to
a distant world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is of interest, your Excellency,&quot; protested Pierre; &quot;but
I have no mind to give it. Consider my plight. I am young,
madly in love, and touched with despair. I turn to you as a
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A father?&quot; echoed the count, with a small gleam of amusement
in his eyes, &quot;Mother of God! It is a name to conjure
with. What will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have lived here long; you know the country well.
Aid me to win the only woman I can ever love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In lawful marriage? Shall I assist you to inclose yourself
in that barbed-wire fence of love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
&quot;There can be no other thought for Miss Onda and me,&quot;
said Pierre, stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent">Count Ronsard shrugged. &quot;You are quixotic. I was so at
your age. Such sentiments are, I assure you, wasted in this
place. The Japanese themselves prefer the laxer course.
They very properly execrate these mixed marriages, especially
legal mixed marriages.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man&#39;s voice was so soft, so kindly, so self-controlled,
that Pierre, in a sort of wonder, turned again to study his
face. The minister met his look with the friendliest of smiles
and a little nod. Then, as if to give the student of physiognomy
every chance, he modestly lowered his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a face that must have been old even in childhood,&mdash;old,
and shrewd, and self-indulgent. The unhealthy fat, which
gave his body an unstable rotundity, showed here chiefly in
the cheeks, sagging them down into loosely filled bags, and
drawing long wrinkles in the pull. The forehead, very narrow
toward the top, with hair growing downward in a deep point,
was as gray as the scant, bristling hair. The whole face,
indeed, was gray; its hueless monotony given emphasis by the
single note of the underlip which protruded, moist, velvety,
and round, like a scarlet fungus from the bark of a rotting
tree.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be candid, my boy,&quot; murmured the minister, still with
eyelids drooped, &quot;your penchant for Miss Onda was already
known to me. A ship is a huge floating laboratory of social
gossip. Touch land, voilà, and the germs fly. My attaché,
Monsieur Mouquin, chanced to witness your meeting with
Papa Onda. He saw your rejection, and the manner in which
your betrothed was heartlessly abducted. We&mdash;that is,
Mouquin and myself&mdash;have even ventured to speculate upon
possibilities, diplomatic possibilities in the interest of France,
that may be lying dormant in your continued&mdash;er&mdash;friendship
with the charming Miss Onda. At the axis of each new
twig of history, Monsieur, sits the love of a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I trust that I do not clearly understand your Excellency,&quot;
said Pierre, fighting down, as he spoke, a whole swarm
of unsavory intuitions.</p>

<p class="indent">The count gave a small, resigned sigh, turned slightly in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
chair, and tapped with one white hand his heap of opened
letters. &quot;Several of these documents suggest the appointment
of a certain young Monsieur Le Beau to office in the French
Legation at Tokio. The old Duc de St. Cyr is writer of
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur le Duc is my great-uncle, and my friend,&quot; said
Pierre.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will realize that it becomes my duty to acquaint
myself with the calibre of such an applicant, of a youth so
highly recommended, and especially at a time when relations
between our country and Japan are slightly&mdash;er&mdash;neuralgic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have no previous record in civil service, but I believe I
could do something for France.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that is just the point!&quot; said the count, with more
eagerness than he had yet showed. &quot;To serve France,&mdash;that
is our whole concern. You have had no training, it is true;
yet you have already a weapon that old and tried diplomats
might weep for. I refer, as you conjecture, to your
friendship with Mademoiselle Onda, daughter of Tetsujo Onda,
and ward, in a sense, of his Highness Prince Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, in a flash, was upon his feet. Cigarette ashes
tumbled from the folds of his waistcoat. He hurled a newly
lighted tube into the fire. &quot;You, sir,&quot; he began, with evident
effort to control his voice, &quot;you, sir, are experienced, and I
am ignorant; you are calm and I am impetuous,&mdash;perhaps
I should listen courteously to what you wish to say; but I
believe it impossible for me to do so. I love this girl as a
man loves the woman whom he desires to make his honored
wife. In England, where I went to school, I learned ideas,
stricter perhaps than Parisian conceptions, of the sacredness
and the responsibility of marriage. This girl is a thing of
snow. No tie could be too strong, no sacrament too safe, for
pledging my fidelity. You see, I could not listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The count, as the young man was speaking, gazed steadily
into the fire. His face remained as expressionless as a leaf.
Pierre, striding here and there in his agitation, came back at
length to the mantel, and stood still. The count spoke
slowly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
&quot;It is far better for France and for you that I speak my
mind fully; yet, because you are ignorant and impetuous, you
cannot, as you say, listen in decent reserve. It is ever so
with youth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The deep sadness of the elder man swept aside Pierre&#39;s
rising indignation. He looked very old now, huddled in the
great chair, his hands spread, palm outward, to the blaze.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre threw himself on an ottoman near. &quot;Pardon my
boorishness. I will listen, Monsieur, though your words be
fangs. You are my mother&#39;s valued friend, and for that alone
I should owe you reverence. Speak what you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the re-mention of the word &quot;mother,&quot; the same curious
look flickered in Ronsard&#39;s eyes. He drew a sigh, gathered
himself into a more upright posture, and asked of Pierre, in
judicial tones, &quot;Let me inquire, Monsieur, whether you and
Mademoiselle Onda, or your friends the Todds, have thought
out any logical conclusion, should the family of Onda determine
that you are to be definitely repulsed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre dropped his head to his hands. &quot;No, we can think
of nothing,&mdash;except elopement, and that, now, is impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you thought for her of a possible forced marriage?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To a Japanese? Yes, my God, when have I not thought
it! No, Monsieur, I do not think it&mdash;I will not; she
would accept death sooner than break her troth to me. I have
her word, her broken hairpin&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A menacing implement&mdash;&quot; interpolated Ronsard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you think it possible, your Excellency?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, the forced marriage?&quot; Ronsard broke off, looked
at Pierre, and then, as if in compassion, removed his gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make it not unendurable,&quot; muttered Pierre, through
whitening lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I make nothing,&quot; said Ronsard. &quot;You have begun the
train of disaster; I can but trace the map of possible retreat.
Yes, I believe truly that the next move in her family will be
to marry her off to some eligible suitor,&mdash;an old man, probably,
one strong enough to keep you and the girl in check.
Some worn-out voluptuary, or a War-God in Pig Iron, like old
Haganè himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre raised bloodshot eyes. His mouth writhed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
opened, but no words came. The old diplomat&#39;s voice had
been like cut velvet, woven on wires of steel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&mdash;you&mdash;do not&mdash;spare&mdash;&quot; Pierre managed to
gasp at length.</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard wore, if anything, a look of satisfaction. He now
lifted a jewelled hand to press and pinch and fondle the moist,
warm cushion of the protruding lip. His eyes, from under
their drooping lids, darted sharp fusillades of meaning upon
his shrinking companion. The very sting restored Pierre.
&quot;Yes,&quot; resumed the other, as if Pierre had spoken, &quot;in such
mariages de convenance personal affection is left aside. Yet
how deplorable&mdash;how impossible&mdash;that a Botticelli in ivory
and pearl should never know the joys of ardent love! Opportunities
always arise. And then, as wife of a Japanese official,
Mademoiselle Onda might prove invaluable to France&mdash;invaluable!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre rose this time slowly. Both delicate hands gripped
the rim of the table hard. For a moment he shut his eyes
that the vision of the sneering, sensual face might not tempt
the blow his young arm tingled to inflict. &quot;It is enough,&quot; he
said, &quot;I was wrong in thinking that I could listen. If your
Excellency will now be so good as to excuse me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard gave a gesture of good fellowship. He smiled
cunningly to himself as Pierre vanished from the room. Self-congratulations
fawned upon him. His aim had been true.
The poisoned arrow was in place, and though Pierre might
snap, or draw it forth, the wound would fester.</p>

<p class="indent">Among his morning letters one had been carefully concealed.
It was of the latest tint and shape of fashion. It smelled of
Paris and intrigue. The last words were these, &quot;Say nothing
to my headstrong boy of this letter, but, for my sake, keep
him from serious entanglement. I object not, you will understand,
to passing follies; but let not the handcuffs of a
Japanese marriage click. Mon Dieu, think of grandchildren!
Yours, for the old time&#39;s sake, Olga Le Beau.&quot; The count read
it through once more, rubbed it thoughtfully against his red
lip, and finally, with a sentimental sigh, placed it on the coals.</p>

<p class="indent">Dropping his head forward, he began to dream. At first it
was of Paris, only Paris, with its gay streets, beautiful women,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
its theatres and supper-rooms. What waste of years to have
lived so long away! Yet in the East had been compensations.
Diplomacy, as he conceived it, was the highest form
of gambling; life itself, a spinning roulette table. Diplomacy
was the only profession for one with romance, poetry, passion
in his veins, and brains in his skull. Pierre, Olga Brekendorff&#39;s
child, was fitted for the career, if, at the outset, he did
not manacle his own hands. He must not marry, least of all
marry a Japanese girl of high connections. Let the girl love
him, and be given to another. Visions of purloined state
papers, of secrets won in the marriage chamber only to be
given France next morning, of Japanese chagrin at the
mysterious betrayal of plans, caressed him with leprous
fingers. Ah, to be young once more and beautiful, like Pierre!
How like his eyes were to the Russian mother! No wonder
the Japanese girl loved him!</p>

<p class="indent">A sharp knock roused him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Entrez! Oidè!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mouquin rushed in as if pursued, leaving the door open.
Within a few feet of Ronsard he stood still, shivering in an
ague of excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what is it? Speak, man. You chatter and grimace
like an ape.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mouquin waved a small square of paper printed in Japanese.
&quot;An extra! War! They say Togo has fired!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard leaned forward and snatched the paper. He read
Japanese well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;War! Togo fired this morning! Three Russian boats
already sunk! Mother of God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The telephone began a frantic ringing. Mouquin went to
it sidewise. &quot;Your Excellency, the Russian minister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold the wire.&quot; Ronsard got to his feet. Mouquin still
chattered. His words came now in a torrent. He was
drunk with the bigness of the hour. &quot;Fired, your Excellency!
Japan the pygmy, with no further provocation, has dared
fire upon Imperial Russia!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard eyed the speaker with a sort of scorn. &quot;True,
Monsieur, and, as I understand, Japan the pygmy has begun
already to sink Imperial Russia.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
Mouquin stared for a moment at the speaker, seeking a clue
to the unexpected words. Perhaps he saw for himself a
chance at singularity. He bowed over, gave a low laugh, and
backing toward the door cried out, &quot;And has begun to&mdash;<i>sink</i>
Imperial Russia! Banzai Nippon!&quot; He went out quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard stood quiet by the telephone. It hissed and bubbled
like an impaled crab. He lifted the receiver slowly, his
eyes still on the door. &quot;I know it now,&quot; he murmured, &quot;I
have long suspected it. Somewhere in this desert of gray
huts Mouquin has a Japanese wife. It was her lips that
uttered through him that &#39;Banzai Nippon.&#39; And so I think
it would soon be with the impressionable Pierre. Hello!
Oui, it is Ronsard.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Into</span> the wide, white streets of modern Yedo, Pierre
stumbled alone. There had been no definite thought in his
hurried flight, only a craving to flee from the polluting face
and soft, compelling voice of his compatriot. How was it
possible for a man with the intelligence of Ronsard to harbor
such ideas of Japanese character? Yuki&#39;s very presence
breathed purity; yet that old man had said&mdash;had dared to
hint&mdash; Pierre broke away from the recollection, hid his
eyes, and groaned. As a consequence he was nearly hurled to
earth by a passing kuruma-man, whose warning cry of &quot;Hek!
Hek!&quot; had been ignored.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre recovered himself with difficulty. The occupant of
the vehicle, a stout burgher of the middle class with sulphur-colored
socks and a gaudy watch-chain, essayed some laughing
excuse; but the wiry human steed, deliberately putting his
shafts to the ground, squared himself before the offending
&quot;Seiyo-jin&quot; to deliver a volley of heterogeneous oaths, selected
at random from the stores of other nations. Pierre, unmoved
by these comic insults, apologized to the burgher in three
languages, and hurried on.</p>

<p class="indent">Now for the first time he noticed that flags were being hung
at every door. Flags fluttered from the backs of jinrikishas
and were stuck on top of pull-cart loads. Past him hurried
newsboys with printed hand-bills held eagerly upward. Small
bells jangled at their hips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nan desu ka?&quot; (What is it?) he asked politely of a
passer-by.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ikusa,&quot; was the brief response, accompanied, as Pierre
could not help seeing, by a disdainful, yet triumphant scowl.
&quot;Ikusa&quot; was a word not included in the Frenchman&#39;s short
vocabulary.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
Four University students, with the exaggeratedly short
skirts, and the brawny, bare legs of the Satsuma faction, came
lurching toward him. All grinned at sight of the alien, and
shouted with one voice, &quot;Banzai Nippon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre understood this phrase at least. &quot;An excellent
sentiment,&quot; he remarked gravely in English; &quot;but now will
you kindly inform me why it seems appropriate to the present
moment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boys nudged one another and giggled. One of them at
length answered in careful English, &quot;Mr. Togo has war already
begun. Many Russian battle-ships, having been this day fired
upon, have into sea-bottom sinked. All will be sinked! Banzai
Nippon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Banzai Nippon!&quot; roared his comrades; and the four, with
sundry delighted, backward glances at the bewildered foreigner,
hurried on.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, ignoring consequences, again stood still. Jinrikishas
clattered past him to the right, to the left, singly, or now in
long, black strings. The faces of human horses and vehicle
occupants were alike vivified by a singular excitement. Many
of the little trotting men conversed volubly with those whom
they bore. &quot;Ikusa! Ikusa!&quot; was the burden of all speech.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ikusa,&quot; repeated Pierre, dully. &quot;This &#39;Ikusa&#39; undoubtedly
means &#39;war.&#39;&quot; He knew in his soul that the rumor was true.
Visions of the scowling Onda, of Prince Haganè, of the leering,
intelligent eyes of Count Ronsard, flew past him with the real
faces of the streets. He cursed aloud. &quot;War!&quot; a new wedge
between himself and Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked on now with nervous energy. &quot;Yu-ki&mdash;Yu-ki&mdash;Yu-ki,&quot;&mdash;his
heart and steps kept pace with the refrain.
The whole world fell into the despairing swing of it. &quot;Yu-ki&mdash;Yu-ki&mdash;Yu-ki!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A little Japanese matron, hastening to a sick neighbor&#39;s
house with the great news, gave him a commiserating glance.
Her husband was a sailor on one of the battle-ships now
fighting. She was proud and happy. What sorrow could it
be that made the young foreigner&#39;s eyes so deep and blue?
Surely this was not war! It must be love. She had heard
that in the affairs of love the foreigners found strange griefs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
&quot;D&#333;-mo!&quot; murmured the little dame to herself, &quot;I am
grateful to the gods this day to be a Japanese with my husband
in a glorious fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre walked now, still unheeding, in a direction almost
due west from the French Legation. On his right hand
stretched the long moats edged stiffly with young willows.
He had been told that these trees were planted by an adoring
people on the day, just fifteen years before, that the Emperor,
out of his wise and loving heart, had given to them a
parliamentary government. Only fifteen years! The willows
had none of them attained full growth, and yet the nation
that had planted them had that morning fired upon one of the
proudest and most implacable empires of old Europe.</p>

<p class="indent">On the enormous campus directly in front of the Imperial
gates, citizens by thousands were assembling. They surged
here and there in a breathless, whispered excitement. Their
lowered voices and moving garments made a sound as of the
sea.</p>

<p class="indent">All eyes were turned upward to the Imperial moat walls,
where white dots of faces belonging to the court ladies
peered over for an instant and vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">The Emperor was not visible. The crowd did not expect
to see him, and had he suddenly manifested himself would
have felt chagrin rather than exultation. They knew that his
heart was with them, and they reverenced him thus silently
with the feeling one has in a vast cathedral, just before the
service begins.</p>

<p class="indent">The Frenchman hurried by with down-bent head, knowing
himself an intruder. At the Sakurada gate of the moat system
he again took his bearings, and saw that by continuing in
a straight course he would reach the American Legation. He
realized on the instant that this was the place where he
wished to go. In all this beautiful, mysterious land he had
but two friends, Mrs. Todd and Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">On a steep slope facing to the northeast, and leading up by
several roads to the broad and thickly populated district of
Azabu, Tokio, can be seen a Japanese gate which is large
without being imposing, and severe without being dignified.
Perhaps the peculiar contours of the land in this unfavored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
spot, the infelicitous swerve of the road, and an awkward
grading of the hill, make the tall gateway always appear
just a little uneasy. This is the main entrance of the American
Legation. Behind it stands a large structure of wood
with office-buildings attached. The contrast of buildings
and gate is not cheerful. Nor is the large surrounding
garden of less amorphous aspect. A wide stretch of well-kept
lawn with no particular outline, disheartening attempts
along the edges at bits of Japanese hill and rock formation,
together with certain unrelated patches of shrub and tree,
coexist in a sort of Eurasian tolerance.</p>

<p class="indent">Pretty Gwendolen openly called her present domicile a
barn. Mrs. Todd had begun at once buying blindly and indiscriminately
from peddlers, hawkers, and &quot;curio-men,&quot; who infest
the official homes of new-comers. As a result, the high
walls of the Legation rooms were being rapidly covered with
atrocious kakèmono, some too high, some too low, and all,
from the standpoint of art, utterly vicious. On tables, shelves,
and mantelpieces stood gaudy Japanese vases such as a native
rag-picker could hardly have been persuaded to use
(though the price given by Mrs. Todd for a single article
might have educated his son), and various household utensils,
each, to the eye of a Japanese visitor, uttering a shriek of
incongruity.</p>

<p class="indent">Should a Japanese lady fill one of her low-ceiled, spacious
rooms with foreign lithographs representing lambs, blue-eyed
children, baskets of fruit, nude women, jockeys, and landscapes,
each in a flaring gold frame, hanging them anywhere
from two feet above the matting to the ceiling line itself,&mdash;should
she, between these rectangular blasphemies, suspend
bits of foreign underwear, old neckties, garters, belts,
hair-brushes, and egg-beaters, and, to complete the artistic
impression, set about on the floor decorated soup-tureens,
water-coolers with growing plants, and lard-baskets piled
high with Japanese cakes,&mdash;an American visitor, entering
for the first time, would get much the same impression that
Japanese visitors derived from Mrs. Todd&#39;s drawing-rooms.</p>

<p class="indent">On this clear morning of February 9, 1904, the American
Legation, in company with all others of the great Eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
capital, hummed and vibrated to the excitement of war. Telephone
wires were kept hot. Messengers went back and forth
ceaselessly with &quot;chits&quot; (notes) written in English, French,
Spanish, German, and other tongues. Carriage-wheels rolled
and rattled in every street. Pierre was ushered into the main
drawing-room, a place which always made him shudder and
think of William Morris. Mrs. Todd, Gwendolen, and Mr.
Dodge were already there. The two latter were standing;
Dodge evidently was on the point of departure. Mrs. Todd
sat close to the soft-coal fire, sewing some green American
fringe on a kesa&mdash;a Buddhist priest&#39;s robe&mdash;which she was to
use for a piano cover.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen, first catching sight of the visitor, went forward
in her bright, impetuous way. &quot;Thank goodness that you
came! Isn&#39;t this war-news exciting? Wasn&#39;t that banquet
last night, after the Red God appeared, a regular skeleton&#39;s
feast? Have you heard from Yuki this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before Pierre could segregate the necessary replies, Minister
Todd was in the room. He walked slowly, studying, with
his thin quaint smile, a large visiting card, apparently just
received. He nodded all around, and then addressed himself
directly to Dodge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prince Haganè has called. Would you advise me to see
him alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, Cy. I won&#39;t hear to it!&quot; protested Mrs. Todd.
&quot;With this war started, he may be intending you bodily
harm!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense, my dear,&quot; said her spouse, patting one plump
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge had been scrutinizing the legend on the pasteboard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is his Highness&#39;s most rigidly official card. Yes, sir,
you will have to see him alone. But don&#39;t commit yourself
by the faintest hint. We have as yet received no instructions
from Washington.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what was that great bunch of cables that came this
morning?&quot; asked the lady, with childlike eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd grinned toward his secretary, who now cast a grinless
and apprehensive look in the direction of Pierre. Dodge
answered for the office, &quot;Those related to an entirely different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
matter, Mrs. Todd, a personal matter. Your husband, Minister
Todd, has had no instructions with regard to this war
just begun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, reddening slightly, beckoned Gwendolen across the
room. They stood staring out across the wide brown lawn.
Mr. Todd and his assistant left the room together. Above the
Buddhist garment she was desecrating, Mrs. Todd murmured
plaintively, &quot;I&#39;ve known it all along,&mdash;though Count Breakitoff
in Washington assured me it could not come. I was
certain that just as soon as I got over here the horrid thing
would break out. Just suppose the Russians capture Tokio!
They boast already that they will dictate terms of peace in
Tokio before next Christmas day, and the Russian troops are
like wild beasts.&quot; Here she gave a shudder, and raised her
voice. &quot;Oh, Gwendolen, why did we leave Washington, or
even our peaceful Western home? I&#39;d give ten thousand
dollars to be set down right now in a good Christian wheat-field.
This is awful, simply <i>awful</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I think it glorious, simply glorious!&quot; sang Gwendolen
from the window. &quot;Already the prospect tingles in my
veins. It is better than a coming-out party, better than auto-mobiling
on a road of green glass! I feel that delicious,
tragic, matinée feeling I used to have as a child, just as the
curtain starts to rise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are not afraid something is going to happen?&quot;
asked Mrs. Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m only afraid that something isn&#39;t going to happen,&quot;
returned the intrepid one.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre sauntered toward the hearth. &quot;I come of a fighting
race, yet now I share Madame&#39;s views rather than those of
her spirited daughter. This war means a new gulf between
Yuki and me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen&#39;s face sobered. &quot;I&#39;ve thought of that. You
are right. It means a wider gulf; it ought to mean a wider
gulf.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre moved nearer the fire and spread his delicate hands
to the flame. &quot;Your tone, Mademoiselle,&quot; he began with a
most pathetic attempt at lightness, &quot;might imply that the
gulf is already of sufficient width to admit despair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
Gwendolen threw back her head and looked at him from
under long lashes. &quot;I didn&#39;t say so,&quot; returned she.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speech is the least satisfactory form of intelligent communication,&quot;
answered Pierre, still trying to smile himself and
her into the delusion that he was but partly in earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see the way that Yuki&#39;s father watched us all last
night?&quot; asked the girl, irrelevantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I cannot say I bestowed much attention. Whenever
possible, I keep my eyes from unpleasing objects.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do well, Pierre,&quot; asserted Mrs. Todd; &quot;especially
in this case. I was next him most of the time, and though I
did not look, I have acquired neuralgia in the shoulder which
was nearest him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He wasn&#39;t what one would call exactly&mdash;gushing,&quot; mused
Gwendolen. She seated herself now, and fell into a sort of
reverie, dropping her chin and catching it in one hand,&mdash;a gesture
ludicrously like Mr. Todd. Pierre&#39;s glance into her face
added, it would seem, to his uneasiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I presume it is only war that has brought Prince Haganè to
call so promptly,&quot; said he, tentatively, with a note of challenge
in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen gave a small sniff. &quot;War! He may call it
war,&mdash;but it is Yuki! Prince Haganè stands behind that
old pickled samurai, Onda; I felt it last night. I tried to
hint it to you then, but you were determined not to see.&quot;
She rose to her feet again, and began to flutter near, in the
fashion most disastrous to Mrs. Todd&#39;s always sensitive
nerves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do sit down, Gwendolen, or you will have my brains as
tangled as this knot of silk,&quot; cried the matron. She began
now to jerk at the shining strands, as if they were partly the
cause of her irritation. In an instant they were reduced to
the condition of a small demented rainbow. Pierre took a low
stool, seated himself near the knee of his hostess, and began
deftly to unravel the tangle.</p>

<p class="indent">He had not tried to answer Gwendolen&#39;s last remark; perhaps
he could not. Something in his face smote the girl&#39;s
generous heart. She knelt at the other side of Mrs. Todd&#39;s
ample knee-space, crying, &quot;Pierre, I have hurt you! I am a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
horrid, brusque girl. I ought to be a telephone &#39;central.&#39; I
didn&#39;t mean to hurt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s just your way, Gwendolen,&quot; admonished Mrs.
Todd. &quot;You will do things first, and repent them after. How
often have I told you that an ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, Madame,&quot; entreated Pierre, &quot;speak not so harshly.
Miss Gwendolen is merely impulsive. I know her for a good
friend of my Yuki, and, I hope, of myself. Such candor may
smart a little, but it is beneficial. The truth is, I am sore,
wounded, aching, from a talk just held with his Excellency
Count Ronsard. I think I came here for balm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You told him of your&mdash;attachment?&quot; questioned Mrs.
Todd, eagerly. Gwendolen rose slowly, went over to a divan
and seated herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;I told him. And for reasons quite
different, quite apart from any that Yuki&#39;s friends or relatives
might urge, he is antagonistic to the idea of my marriage.
Of course his opposition means nothing to me. I care not
if the whole of France sailed East to prevent me. My faith
is bound to Yuki, and I shall not give her up. But in the
matter of official appointment Count Ronsard can make difficulties.
Indeed I am convinced that he has been holding my credentials
all along, and, for his own whim, will not give them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen had listened quietly to the full speech, though
her eyes were shining with anger. &quot;The old sinner!&quot; she
exclaimed; &quot;the idea of his daring to object to Yuki! What
were his reasons, I would like to know!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre flushed. &quot;To put it delicately,&mdash;that Yuki is not of
French descent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen bridled. &quot;Oh, I see! You needn&#39;t say any more.
Probably he would object to me for the same reason, thinking
me an alloy of red Indian and buffalo. For sheer, crass ignorance,
commend me to the European savant! Well, I would
like to go to Mr. Ronsard and just inform him that there is
no king nor emperor of Europe who need not be proud to win
my Yuki-ko!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may be sure I told him, with enough of vehemence
to suit even you, Mademoiselle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
&quot;The miserable old wretch!&quot; murmured Mrs. Todd, above
the kesa.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen&#39;s gaze, now that the anger died, went moodily
to Pierre. He met the look with a smile no less winning for
its sadness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pierre, you are a dear boy,&quot; she said, her own eyes suddenly
stung by tears; &quot;I know Yuki loves you, and I can&#39;t
blame her. I wish&mdash;oh, I wish you could be happy together;
but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you not omit that last small word?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl sighed deeply, then leaned forward, her elbows on
her knees. &quot;Pierre,&quot; she was beginning in great seriousness;
she had in her mind to ask whether, if once convinced of the
impossibility of marriage with Yuki either now or ever, he
would still demand from her fidelity, defiance of her parents,
and of all the established rules of her class,&mdash;still hold her
to that promise he had wrung.</p>

<p class="indent">Since that banquet of the Red God, only the evening before,
and now fleeing with strange rapidity into the past,&mdash;since she
had seen Pierre&#39;s very charm and artistic sensitiveness used
as clever traps for his entanglement, he meantime suspecting
nothing, Gwendolen felt not only that the marriage would be
indefinitely postponed, but that it would be finally prevented.
The subtlety, the ideality, the self-sacrificing impulses of a
Japanese nature indissolubly bound to Pierre must mean
sorrow, if not degeneration to both. As well try to graft a
French geranium upon the stem of a young bamboo! Before
she could put her question, Mr. Todd, re-entering, diverted all
interest to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd was first to speak. &quot;Oh, Cy, tell me quick!
Has war really begun, or were those reports only to frighten
us? Did he confess that war had come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn&#39;t confess, exactly. He admitted war, as he might
have admitted that the day was cold or the wind blowing. I
never feel quite myself before that man! He charges me with
electricity first, and then hypnotizes me afterward. As clearly
as I can make out, it was a friendly visit, its particular object
being to ascertain correctly the amount of indisposition acquired
by each separate guest from last night&#39;s revelry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
&quot;Revelry,&quot; murmured Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you did not tell him that I had nightmare, Cy!&quot;
said Mrs. Todd, anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you did tell him that I think Japanese food delicious,
and would like to live on it,&quot; cried Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did,&quot; said her father. &quot;He looked bored. Evidently
charming young American women are nothing to Prince
Haganè. His chief concern, it seemed, was Pierre.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;Monsieur?&quot; echoed Pierre, with a nervous start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I can&#39;t recall now any very direct questions,&mdash;he
didn&#39;t exactly &#39;pump,&#39; yet in his esoteric way he let me know
that all I could tell him of you he would be glad to learn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre tried to meet Gwendolen&#39;s eyes, but she had turned
away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you speak of my Russian mother, Mr. Todd?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I had the chance, but dodged it. I thought it none
of his Highness&#39;s business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Merci,&quot; murmured the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speaking of Dodging it,&quot; put in Gwendolen; &quot;where is
your secretary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He got a &#39;chit&#39; from the Spanish Legation, and asked for
an hour&#39;s leave of absence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That fat Carmen Gil y Niestra,&quot; puffed Mrs. Todd. (Mrs.
Todd&#39;s own weight was over the two hundred mark, yet she was
scathing in her scorn of avoirdupois in another.) &quot;These
European women are shameless in the way they run after
men. She&#39;s shadowing Dodge now. I wonder what she can
want of him.&quot; The good lady applied herself with renewed
diligence to her robe. Gwendolen studied the stucco-work of
the ceiling. In the somewhat strained silence Pierre rose.
Mr. Todd was close to him. He put a hand affectionately on
the boy&#39;s shoulder, and looked down into his face. Pierre, in
spite of efforts for self-control, shrank back, his lips quivering
with a prescience of new pain.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen ran to his defence. &quot;We know what you are
going to say. It has been spoken already. Spare us, dad.
We are all upset this morning, and when one is upset good
advice is an insult. I challenge you to a set at tennis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
Pierre. Come, come, the court is perfect, though the skies
be gray.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre turned eagerly. &quot;Capital, nothing could be better.
But my costume,&mdash;I have not the necessary flannels, shoes&mdash;&quot;
He looked himself over in concern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have your legs and arms, I presume,&quot; said Gwendolen,
dryly.</p>

<p class="indent">Catching up the rackets and a box of balls, she hurried out,
leaving the glass door open.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shut the door, Pierre,&quot; called Mrs. Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd watched the slim young figure as he went. Faithful
to Mrs. Todd&#39;s admonition, he closed the panel with the greatest
care, rattling the knob to show that the latch had caught.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Todd sighed. &quot;I wish that door opened into France,
and that I held a St. Peter&#39;s key to it,&quot; he murmured, as if
to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd wondered above the robe. &quot;What&#39;s that pretty
thing you&#39;re making?&quot; asked her spouse, quickly. &quot;A piano
cover? Gwendolen ought to play a regular &#39;Streets of Cairo&#39;
potpourri under that. Aren&#39;t you afraid the old priest&#39;s
ghost will haunt you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do talk such nonsense for a grown-up, intelligent
man,&quot; reproved his dame, but her lips and her eyes smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those are the times when I make my most sensible
remarks,&quot; said he, in return.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you know,&quot; retorted his Susan, with doubt in
her voice.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Returning</span> home from the princely banquet side by side in
the double jinrikisha, not a word had been spoken between
Tetsujo Onda and his child. The master went at once into
his little study, banging shoji and fusuma close around him.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, forcing back her sad thoughts, related to her mother
and the eager servants an account of the many beautiful
dishes at the feast. For their amusement she even told a
few of the queer foreign mistakes. Some of these were
received by Maru San in gasping horror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ma-a-a-a!&quot; she cried once. &quot;A foreign lady, rich and
educated, leave&mdash;one&mdash;chopstick&mdash;standing on its head in
a bowl of rice! Ma-a! But how can I believe that? Miss
Yuki must be joking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just think what foolish things you would do at a foreign
banquet, with their awkward knives, forks, and spoons,&quot;
said Yuki, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">Maru shook her head. This revolution of the poles of
etiquette was too much for her brain.</p>

<p class="indent">Each article of Yuki&#39;s attire, beginning with the heavy
satin obi (sash), was carefully folded, pressed smooth by the
hands, and put away lovingly in a lacquered clothes-chest.
Sometimes Iriya performed this service, sometimes Suzumè.
Yuki and Maru were both considered too inexperienced for
such careful manipulation.</p>

<p class="indent">That night it was the old warrior&#39;s turn to remain awake,
staring at the ceiling, spelling out the future by the andon&#39;s
dim light, and planning ways to rescue his daughter from
her mad attachment without inflicting unnecessary pain. For
Yuki was indeed the pride of his heart. It was a humiliation
as well as a sorrow that she should be willing to repudiate her
nationality.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
With his slow wits and somewhat rigid cast of mind he
had not caught the full importance of the evening just passed,
or the significance of the test in which the Red God had
played so large a part. Yet in his daimyo&#39;s eye, as it rested
on Yuki, he had seen something that stirred the blood in the
old samurai&#39;s veins. Surely not even the ladies of the golden
Fujiwara age had been more beautiful than Yuki-ko. Then,
Haganè was not indifferent to beauty in women. Could it be
possible&mdash; But no! Tetsujo dared not let this fancy spread.
His skull would split with it. Groaning, he turned on his
wooden pillow and tried to sleep&mdash;but in vain.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile his daughter, not twenty feet away, behind
her silver fusuma, lay in dreamless quiet. The certainty of
Haganè&#39;s implication, and the tremendous opposition it involved,
steadied and concentrated her. She knew what she
had before her and deliberately willed the sleep that should
bring strength.</p>

<p class="indent">In the early dawn, within the sound of her father&#39;s restless
tossing, she crouched against a shoji, and in the faint pink
glow wrote an English letter. Every motion showed care.
The rustling of the long sheets of Japanese paper would have
betrayed her, so she wrote in pencil on a little pad that bore
the name of a stationer in Washington. From time to time
she consulted an open letter in a man&#39;s writing, a wild, illogical,
despairing letter,&mdash;the one that Gwendolen had brought
some days before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How will your thoughts be this gray morning, my dear?&quot;
she wrote to him. &quot;Last night you were as one stung by
happy madness. You would not see nor hear my warnings.
Now you will be realizing why I wished to make warnings.
Lord Haganè is with my father against us. They wish me
not to marry with a foreigner. That terrible painting was a
test, and I have betrayed us by my woman&#39;s soft heart.
Now they are sure that the one I love is in Tokio they will
take stronger care against me. Dear Pierre, I do not think
there is any hope! We can wait,&mdash;or we can die!&mdash;just
now I believe nothing else is possible. O Pierre! If my
weakness offend you, and if already it seem to you far beyond
any help,&mdash;if you, being the impatience, have not heart to so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
long wait,&mdash;let me go! Forget poor Yuki! Indeed, I should
not have promised at all. I belong to my country, as in
previous time I said. I must not make sad your bright life.
Rather would I be forgotten than bring you to grief. Your
Yuki-ko.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This letter she addressed to Pierre at the French Legation,
stamped, sealed it, and slipped it into the long, hanging sleeve
of her kimono, intending, at the first opportunity, to get it
into the hands of a postman. After this she arranged her
hair and obi quickly and went out into the kitchen where
already she heard old Suzumè and Maru San at work. Hardly
had she entered when the front gate opened and the newspaper-boy
ran in, his small copper bell clamoring on his hip.
His bovine face was crimson with suppressed joy. Beside the
usual morning sheet he held out a printed extra, shaking it
toward her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look at this! Honorably read these headlines, o jo san!
Banzai Nippon!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki reached forward for the hand-bill. &quot;It is war! War!
Togo has fired!&quot; she read, in a low, tense voice. &quot;War with
that great brutal nation, and we have fired! O Nippon!
O my Emperor! The ancient gods be with you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Three ships already sunk! Three!&quot; screamed the boy,
wildly, and tossed up his foreign jockey-cap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kwannon preserve us! What has happened&mdash;an earthquake?&quot;
cried old Suzumè, hastening from the well-curb, and
wiping red hands on her apron as she came.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;War! War, nurse! Our country is at war this minute,
and three Russian battle-ships are already sunk!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll teach the bears that we are not to be trampled&mdash;Banzai
Nippon!&quot; boasted the paper-boy, as he hurried back to
the street.</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya, not quite dressed, thrust her head from the parted
fusuma.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;War, Mistress! War, Master! The honorable Mr. Togo
has sunk all the Russian battle-ships and beheaded all the
generals with his own hand!&quot; shrieked Suzumè. Maru began
to cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;War!&quot; faltered Iriya, and shrank back into the dim room.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
&quot;Banzai! May our Emperor live a thousand years!&quot; roared
Tetsujo. Those outside could hear him hurtling about the
narrow room. &quot;Tell them to hang the flags above the gate,
woman! Quick! Every moment wasted is a sacrilege! Gods
of my Ancestors, at last we fight! Would that I were with
Togo!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya, after giving orders for the flags, threw herself before
the family shrine, where lights burned always in small, steady,
pointed flames. &quot;Ancestral spirits of our home, old deities
of this land, give strength to our soldiers and sailors!&quot; she
whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo brushed past her, fully equipped for walking. His
old face twitched with eagerness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you not wait for your worthless breakfast, honorable
master?&quot; ventured Suzumè.</p>

<p class="indent">Onda gave a loud laugh and tossed the old dame a handful
of coin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Breakfast! I&#39;m eating and drinking food of the gods!
Here! Take this money, and all of you women go to your
temple and make offering! I seek the public places where
men assemble.&quot; Suddenly he halted. Haganè&#39;s last words
came to his ears. His face turned black, and he slowly walked
into the house with bent head. &quot;I had forgotten&mdash;I cannot
go. Serve the breakfast as usual,&quot; he muttered in the voice
of an old man. Stumbling into the main room he said under
his breath, &quot;Hachiman Sama, help me to endure! On a day
like this&mdash;I, Onda Tetsujo&mdash;I a warrior of Haganè&#39;s clan&mdash;I
must be held here like a tame cock in a bamboo basket!
Had I not seen the look in his Highness&#39;s eye&mdash;I might
hurl all aside and take the risk&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Soft footsteps had been following him. He wheeled, to face
Yuki. Her eyes were gleaming and steady, though her face
had crimsoned with shame. &quot;Father,&quot; she began proudly,
&quot;I know the reason of your return. All your heart burns to
be with other men, and to hear full news of this mighty event.
Go, I entreat you! There is no fear of what&mdash;you and Prince
Haganè think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old warrior himself now showed embarrassment. He
would not meet her gaze, but let his eyes move restlessly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
about the floor as he answered: &quot;Yes, my old heart strains
like a bowstring to be gone&mdash;and I do not dare! You
defied me once,&mdash;my blood grows hot at the thought of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still, I am your daughter,&quot; said Yuki. &quot;And I think you
will believe me when I offer you my pledge that, from this
moment till your return, even though it be a week hence,
I shall not leave this house and garden, shall not admit a
foreign guest to it nor listen to foreign speech.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe you,&quot; said Tetsujo, with great relief in his face.
&quot;You will neither go nor admit a foreign guest&mdash;nor write
and receive letters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki caught up her sleeve. Onda&#39;s face darkened. Deliberately
drawing forth the letter she offered it to her father,
saying, &quot;Here is one I have already written and shall send.
Will you not trust me even further and be the one by whose
hand it goes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me post it? Me put it in a box?&quot; he asked in amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The meaning it bears is not against your desire, father.
Rather may it destroy an evil that already lives. I ask you
to take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To bargain thus with a mere girl&mdash;&quot; the samurai muttered.
Then he threw his head back. &quot;My blood is in your
veins. I trust you. Give it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, choking back a little sob, fell at his feet and touched
her forehead to the floor. She heard his quick and heavy
tread shiver through the house. Then followed, coming in her
direction, the gentler steps of Iriya.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki lifted her arms. &quot;Mother, mother!&quot; she cried passionately,
&quot;why could I not have been born a man? To
die for one&#39;s country, in battle, with the thought of the
Emperor like a cooling draught at the lips! To stand on the
great black ship, smiling in storm and snow and fog, driven in
like fate itself to glorious chances! Oh, that is to <i>live!</i> But
to be a woman&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Iriya, quietly seating herself. &quot;The fortunate
are those who know, in this incarnation, full expression of a
burning heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you feel so too, mother?&mdash;you, who are always so
tranquil and so dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
&quot;I too am a samurai&#39;s daughter. In the strife of Restoration
days I saw my father and my brother die&mdash;I saw my
mother live.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dearest one, how selfish we young souls are. We are
like green fruit that has no mellowness. You have suffered
so deeply&mdash;and I never guessed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya, with half-closed eyes on the garden, uttered words
which until the hour of her death never quite loosed their
echoes from the girl&#39;s heart. &quot;Young souls are indeed unripe
in the ways of love. That suffering of mine was mere indifference
to the grief I shall know if, at an hour like this,
with Nippon in the throes of re-birth, my only child should
become the wife of her enemy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki cowered back. She could not look her mother in the
face. Up to this moment she had never dreamed that Iriya
had been told anything. The sense of comradeship and of interdependence
between a Japanese husband and wife is very
strong; but in this case, where Tetsujo&#39;s angry violence had
been so out of keeping with the whole tenor of his life, Yuki
was perhaps justified in feeling that he would prefer to maintain
a sullen reticence.</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya&#39;s words, and the way she spoke them, showed not only
that she was conversant with the whole threatening situation,
but that she had thought and prayed deeply. It did not seem
at all the every-day domestic Iriya that spoke, but an older
and more impersonal spirit, issuing from borrowed human,
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">An uncomfortable silence fell between them. Iriya sat rigid
and upright, as a silver image in a Buddhist niche. Little
Yuki, feeling very small and young and human, crept noiselessly
to her own room.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Tetsujo did not return until the following day. He showed
evidences of strong excitement, and could not for a while be
seated, but strode up and down the matted floor of the house,
throwing off ejaculations and phrases of war-news. He had
much to tell in his irritating, disjointed way. But Japanese
women do not show impatience. They knelt out of range of
his feet, but within good hearing, following his motions with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
feverish eagerness, and snatching at his words as at whizzing
fireflies. Names of those killed, quotations from foreign
newspapers, reports from the Tokio war-office, maledictions
upon himself that he was too old to go,&mdash;all came in a
scurrying swarm from the samurai&#39;s lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Refused me&mdash;they refused me,&mdash;those grinning, foreignized
apes at the war-office. Even my daimyo will not help
me. An age limit? Gods! Trained men must twirl their
thumbs while boys with soft hearts and flabby muscles defend
the Emperor! Would that I had ten thousand lives to give,
and that each life in passing held the agonies of ten thousand
deaths. Even that would be but a handful of blown petals to
the whirling majesty of Nippon in the breath of the Eternal.&mdash;But
wait! There are many young men now, there are hills
of powder and river-beds of shot; but when that powder
melts like snow in a spring rain, when the last shot stings the
air, then may the sword-arm leap to usefulness. The Cossacks
cut and slay like demons,&mdash;why not we? For whom
then will be the cry but for old Onda? Onda Tetsujo! who
has cut three bodies through with one slow, steady stroke;
who has bared a living bone so swiftly that the slain creature
turned inquisitive eyes on death! Bah, I babble and rave
like a Meiji actor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet, Lord, it may come,&mdash;it may come,&quot; whispered Iriya,
aloud. &quot;Daily I shall pray and sacrifice that this desire of
our hearts be granted.&quot; Yuki looked upon these heroic beings
that had given her life, and knew the pangs of self loathing.
What was she, their only child, now doing for the land
they loved? Planning ways of remaining faithful to a foreign
lover! She drooped her head still lower. Alas! Had Pierre
not taken that promise from her unguarded soul! If Pierre
even now would give her up&mdash;would understand.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo, still fuming in a noble rage, cut the floor in cross-lines
of hasty striding. He turned at intervals, catching back
his flight, raising himself up to silence as if he heard a bugle-note,
staring, unseeing, into the garden, then clenching his
fists, muttering new imprecations, and throwing himself again
into his restless walk. The essence of Yamato Damashii
breathed from him. One listened for the clank of steel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
shark&#39;s-skin armor. His right hand felt incessantly for the
vanished sword-hilts. All at once he stopped directly before
Yuki, transfixed her with fierce, tormented eyes and cried,
&quot;Onda Yuki, you are a samurai&#39;s daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki met his look. &quot;I am a samurai&#39;s daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See that you forget it not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant longer he glared into her upraised face, then
flinging himself away he muttered, &quot;Oh, that I had a son to
offer,&mdash;one son only to serve my land! They would not let
me go.&quot; He seated himself at last; folded his arms within
the short, blue, cotton sleeves; and sank into a brooding
revery.</p>

<p class="indent">With a few days the first frenzy and tumult of the war
were over. The nation settled into a state of watchful and
sober patriotism. Men turned to practical work, raising
money for the war fund, for all knew that it was indeed a
struggle for life or death.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki had received by mail another letter. Tetsujo was
present when it came. She read and re-read it slowly, under
his very eyes, and then tore it into scraps, letting them fall in
small white flecks upon the red coals of the hibachi. Onda
stared at her, fascinated, but found nothing to say.</p>

<p class="indent">The note was in Pierre&#39;s most appealing vein. He urged
her, for the sake of both, to be a heroine. He forgave her, a
thousand times over, her hint of betrayal of the night before.
Again he congratulated himself and her on his foresight in
compelling the stricter pledge. &quot;You must see now, my poor,
sorrowful darling, that it is the only thing to hold us back
from despair.&quot; Yuki&#39;s heart sagged within her. She attempted
no reply. She wondered dully how so flaming a
love failed to illuminate reason. Pierre simply could not
understand. Well, she must be calm and clear enough
for both. Her deepest fear, but half admitted, was that
Tetsujo, with Prince Haganè behind, would now attempt
to end the matter by marrying her to some young noble
of their acquaintance. She hardly dared face the thought of
what her home life might become after her repudiation of
such an offer.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen remained apart, and Yuki rightly guessed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
it was at Minister Todd&#39;s instigation. She never for a moment
doubted Gwendolen&#39;s loyal affection. This restraint was a
proof of it, as also of Mr. Todd&#39;s clear judgment.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre began now, in his restless misery, to haunt the streets
immediately surrounding Yuki&#39;s home. Apparently he wished
to establish, as a signal, a certain little quaint air from Carmen
that he loved. He would whistle a phrase and pause,
evidently expecting her to continue with the answering melody.
At twilight, one day nearly a week after &quot;the banquet of the
Red God&quot; (as she always thought of it), she was standing
alone beside her plum-tree, now almost bare of flowers. The
sky stretched low and heavy, as a giant tent hung with unspilled
rain. No sunlight had come with the day. The wind
pinched and stung with dampness. As she stared mournfully
upon the falling petals, holding out a languid hand to stay
their flight, a few large flakes of snow came down.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I gathered petals, to show thee, love.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But now, in my hands they have melted&mdash;&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">she quoted aloud from a classic.</p>

<p class="indent">Her parents had been talking together in the main corner-room,
where now a servant brought lights. On the closed
paper shoji, just beside her, the silhouettes of two beloved
forms sprang into sudden vivid blackness. Tetsujo&#39;s stern,
Indian-like profile was turned, while Iriya showed only the
outlines of her coiffure, with the droop of slender shoulders
and the flower-like poise of a delicate throat. His attitude,&mdash;all
dignity, self-assertion, manliness; and hers, concessive,
yielding, and full of feminine grace,&mdash;symbolized to the girl
the true relations, in Japan, of man and wife. &quot;And is it not
better?&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;Are the aggressive American
women happier or more beloved?&quot; She thought of the
domestic scandals, the unhappy marriages openly discussed
at Mrs. Todd&#39;s table. Here, at least, though such sad things
did sometimes occur, they seldom became topics of general
conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">The bell of the front gate rang out through the gray air.
Yuki, with a sudden leap of the heart she could not account
for, threw an arm about the tree and clung to it, listening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
breathlessly. Through the paper-walled house came clearly
the sounds of old Suzumè as she opened the door. &quot;Hai!
Hai! Sayo de gozaimasu. Hai, danna!&quot; (Yes, yes. It is
augustly so! Yes, master.) Even the sharp indrawn breath
was audible. Surely it was a visitor of importance,&mdash;and not
a foreigner. In an instant a third silhouette was added to
the two in the room. This bore a small parcel in its hands,
and bowed very deeply before Tetsujo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A messenger direct from the august Prince Haganè!&quot;
said Suzumè&#39;s proud voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki saw the shadow of her father snatch the package and
toss aside the cloth furoshiki in which it was wrapped. She
saw the shadow open a letter, start, bend his head nearer.
She saw strong shadow-hands tremble, and heard a voice,
which strove in vain for steadiness, give the orders: &quot;Fold
the furoshiki carefully, and return it done up in clean paper.
Give to the messenger my respects. There is no immediate
reply. Offer him fresh tobacco, tea, and cakes&mdash;the best we
have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai! Hai! Kashikomarimasu&quot; (Yes, yes! I hear and
respectfully obey), murmured Suzumè&#39;s voice. Her shadow
bobbed once, twice, to the matting, and vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki gripped the tree hard. A messenger from Prince
Haganè! and that deep, triumphant note in her father&#39;s
voice! What could it mean?</p>

<p class="indent">The shadow of Iriya was now reading the note. A cry
came. &quot;O my husband! It is too wonderful&mdash;too splendid.
It will solve all difficulties. I must not believe&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the cowering girl white snowflakes, her namesakes, fell
now quickly, dotting her dark hair. One, falling on a
cheek as white, melted slowly, and pretended that it was a
tear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Call the girl!&quot; said Tetsujo. Iriya rose in haste. Yuki
sped back along the narrow veranda to her own room. &quot;And
summon the two serving-women also!&quot; came Tetsujo&#39;s voice,
on a higher note.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki entered with what calmness she could. The two servants
already squatted like bright-eyed toads in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, girl! Read this letter from his Highness, Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
Haganè,&quot; said Onda. &quot;Bow, as you receive it into your
unworthy hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl bowed obediently. She read the letter through
without a flicker of change on her downcast face. Folding it
with scrupulous care she returned it, again bowing, to her
wondering father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he cried, &quot;are your wits gone? What have you
to say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His Highness does our house too much honor,&quot; answered
Yuki, quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya, watching breathlessly, saw what the puzzled Onda
did not see, that, in spite of superb self-control, a slow, sick
pallor was stealing into the girl&#39;s face. Behind Iriya the
two servants, drawn closer as by a magnet, vibrated to suppressed
excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">Onda caught the look of their faces. &quot;Suzumè!&quot; he said,
&quot;your young mistress has just been asked in marriage by his
Augustness, Prince Haganè, daimyo of our clan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ma-a-a!&quot; breathed the women in unison, and fell forward
on their faces.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see what <i>they</i> think of it,&quot; said Tetsujo, with a half-contemptuous
wave of his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my daughter,&quot; cried Iriya, &quot;it is an honor so great
that I cannot yet meet the thought of it. You will be like a
Princess of the Blood. Our sacred Empress will meet you
face to face as a friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo broke in. &quot;You can serve your country, girl!
That&#39;s the best of it. The opportunity is incredible. It
does not need argument. Well, Yuki! Will you write your
humble and grateful acceptance in person, or shall I convey it
for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not accepted yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo bounded in his place. Iriya caught her breath, and
stretched forth two pleading hands, one to each.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not anger me, girl!&quot; muttered the father, with visible
effort to contain himself. &quot;I am in no mood for violence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor I, father, being already spent with much contention,&quot;
answered Yuki, wearily. &quot;Indeed, I should attempt no
speech at all, but that I see his Highness shields me by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
commands against rough argument, and the condition that I
be given full time to decide.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah,&quot; cried Tetsujo. &quot;Even a god must have some small
weaknesses. Pity to women has always been his.&mdash;Well,
when shall your answer go&mdash;to-night, in the morning, on
the first rays of the sun? Speak! for my choler trains me
hard!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Yuki did not hasten to reply. Behind her rigid calm
a thousand frightened fancies sped. No thought could be followed
to a conclusion in this first whirl of atoms. They went
by her in a soundless hurricane,&mdash;torn bits of hope, filaments
of fear, thin flakes of readjustment. She saw that
time must be gained&mdash;time, and the opportunity to think.
An unqualified refusal would bring upon her immediately
consequences and new conditions which she was neither
physically nor mentally able to combat. She must achieve
an armistice.</p>

<p class="indent">After an interval that seemed long to her but interminable
to the quivering Onda, she raised her face, saying quietly:
&quot;After a space of three days, at the hour of twilight, I will
myself deliver an answer to Prince Haganè. Will you kindly
convey this message?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will answer in three days! Lord of Hell! she will
condescend to answer my daimyo in three days! This bit of
spoken offal&mdash;must I present to a deity who burdens himself
with you&mdash;that your family may be honored, and your cheap
foreign attainments used! His magnanimity is inconceivable.
To a lesser man it would seem impossible. To marry you
openly,&mdash;make you a princess,&mdash;you, a shivering wench he
could have for the taking!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He could <i>not</i> have me for the taking, and you know it!&quot;
said Yuki&#39;s low voice, that held an undercurrent of his own.
&quot;You shame yourself and me by such raving. If you insult
me further I will refuse at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Yuki! Come quickly!&quot; whispered the terrified
Iriya, dragging at her daughter&#39;s sleeve. &quot;Your honored father
will strangle in his rage. Never, never, in all our married life
have I seen his eyes glare thus! Hasten!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;hasten&mdash;drag her away!&quot; gasped Tetsujo, throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
back his head and clutching his collar. &quot;She is not my
daughter! Would that my bones had crumbled&mdash;&quot; His
words broke off in a gurgle.</p>

<p class="indent">In her little room Yuki stood gazing down moodily upon the
convulsed form of her mother. &quot;I know I ought to feel more
pain to see you weep so bitterly, my mother,&quot; she said at
length. &quot;I tell myself that I should feel, but I cannot feel.
Somehow I seem to be wearing armor inside instead of outside.
Think of it, mother, what it means to me! I love a man who
loves me honorably. I do not ask a sudden marriage,&mdash;I would
wait patiently until the war is over, and perhaps your heart
and father&#39;s would be softened toward my hope. I will work
for you,&mdash;I will go out and be a servant, a teacher,&mdash;anything
to relieve you of my burden. All I ask is to remain uncompelled
toward other marriage. Yet here my father, and an
old man older than my father, are trapping me,&mdash;they condescend
to trap me! Prince Haganè cannot possibly wish me
for his wife. He has seen me but twice since I was a child.
A man like Haganè does not know love in the sense I have been
taught it. Oh, I am like a bird ensnared in chains&mdash;in chains
so heavy&mdash;that I can scarcely stir a link! Being a samurai&#39;s
daughter I cannot even die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki! Would you indeed disgrace us by marrying&mdash;a
Russian?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not so long as it seems to you a disgrace. But that will
not last forever, mother. This war is to change many things.
Can I not belong to myself, just for the time of this war,
mother? Will you not plead with father for this boon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare not! I dare not!&quot; shuddered Iriya. &quot;I fear your
father, for the first time in my life.&mdash;There! He is calling.
I must go.&quot; She caught one of the girl&#39;s dangling hands
and pressed it convulsively against a tear-wet cheek. &quot;May
Kwannon soothe your bewildered heart, my loved one!&quot; she
murmured, and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I prefer you to have as little as possible to do with that
hardened and ungrateful wretch!&quot; came Tetsujo&#39;s voice, as
Iriya entered to him. Yuki knew that it was raised purposely
for her to hear. Iriya evidently attempted some conciliatory
reply, for he burst out angrily, &quot;Don&#39;t defend her, woman!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
It is disrespect to me. I tell you she shall consent, whether
she wishes it or not!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki smiled the smile that leaves a taint upon the soul.
&quot;There are a few things that even a father&mdash;even a Japanese
father&mdash;cannot do!&quot; she said aloud.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">If</span> previous days in the Onda household had been tense,
those following were to reach the ultimate limit of nerve-endurance.
Immediately after his last tempestuous scene
with Yuki, Tetsujo had left the house. Yuki was minded
to call after him, protesting that her promise given him on
the first day of war did not hold indefinitely. She moved
forward, the words nearly sped, when he turned on her a look
and gesture so repellent that she cowered, and let him pass.
It did not seem at all her father who now looked at her, but
rather some angry Spirit of War, in temporary assumption of
Onda&#39;s body.</p>

<p class="indent">War! War! War! The streets thrilled to it. The sparrows
chirped it. The jinrikisha wheels rattled a pygmy fusillade.
In this flare of national ardor all passions burned
more hotly, and among them, Tetsujo&#39;s indignation against
his only child. Iriya, being more inexperienced than Yuki
herself in interpretation of men&#39;s fiercer moods, could not tell
her that such caloric outbursts would die the sooner from their
own exaggeration. Yuki moaned, and shut her hot eyes from
a future where her father should always be angry, and her
mother always trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">Early next day, after the reading of Haganè&#39;s letter, the
women of Onda&#39;s house were surprised to find their domestic
retinue silently increased by the addition of two grim, middle-aged
men who called themselves gardeners. From their reading
of all &quot;War Extras&quot; that the jangling bell of the newsboy
announced, and from their sporadic and often devastating
attacks on harmless shrubs, one might have doubted their
skill in the professed art. Tetsujo disdained explanation,
and gave the one order that they were to be suitably fed at
meal-times in the kitchen, and treated with the consideration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
due to servants hired specially by himself. Iriya had not
the heart, scarcely the curiosity, to question. All that day
she moved about, a silent, timid figure of protesting obedience.
Yuki understood at once that her mother had been told to
ignore her. She understood, also, the meaning of the so-called
&quot;gardeners,&quot; and turned to her father slow, scornful
eyes, which he refused to meet.</p>

<p class="indent">What the young seldom realize, in a case like this, is the
suffering of those in authority, who, according to adolescent
eyes, delight in imparting sorrow. Yuki was convinced that
this strange changeling of a father revelled in his cruelty.
She forced herself into defiant composure, chiefly in the hope
of detracting from his supposed enjoyment. Her mother&#39;s
white face was another matter. She looked on that just as
little as possible. Old Suzumè and Maru grew to partake
of their master&#39;s elfish obsession. Their peering faces and
bright eyes, quickly withdrawn, maddened her.</p>

<p class="indent">No hope or thought of solution had come through the
troubled night, nor, as yet, with the gray day. Tetsujo had
gone, presumably, to convey the detested message to his
prince. Yuki&#39;s one conscious determination was to send another
message to Pierre, which should state clearly and comprehensively
the new difficulty that had assailed her. Almost
certainly her father had arranged that no more letters should
go forth or be received. The gardeners and Suzumè would
see to that. At times she had a wild fancy of attempting
flight, urging Pierre to rescue her in the fashion of mediæval
romance, and to take her to the Todds, or to some Christian
missionary, where they could be married and so set beyond
the reach of Haganè and her father. But would it set her
beyond the black tide of her own remorse? How then should
she reconcile her fondest belief, that in a union with Pierre
she might serve to bring closer French and Japanese friendship?
This would be outrage, anarchy, at the start. Yet
something must be done,&mdash;something at least to remove
her, temporarily, from her father&#39;s loathing sight after she
should have refused Haganè&#39;s proposition. In this, perhaps,
Pierre himself could assist, or Gwendolen,&mdash;if she could
only see Gwendolen. &quot;Gwendolen!&quot; She stretched out her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
arms to the sunless, vacant sky, and called her friend&#39;s name
aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether telepathy is a fact, or merely a pet child of some
philosophers, whether or not the ether of the East holds
subtler vibrations than our own, it is certain that exactly at
this moment Gwendolen awoke in her foreign bed from hurrying
dreams of Yuki, and lay awake, staring, a sudden weight of
apprehension full upon her. The excitement of war may have
sharpened American senses also. Gwendolen&#39;s mind ran back
for the hundredth time to that strange, memorable banquet.
Its meaning grew now more sharp and sinister. Something
had taken place there, something intangible, but very real,
something decisive, fatal, the effect of which would first appear
in Yuki. Gwendolen had as her birthright some of
her father&#39;s intuitive judgment of character. She had read that
night the hatred of foreigners in Tetsujo&#39;s sullen face, and
did not dislike him for it. Haganè baffled her; but she had
noted how deep were the eyes fixed now on Yuki, now on
Pierre. Neither of them would wish for Yuki to become the
wife of Pierre, and neither did Gwendolen wish it. The girl
smiled curiously at her feeling of distaste. It did not seem
right for Yuki to marry a foreigner, even an utterly charming
and immorally beautiful foreigner like Pierre Le Beau.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I must have been a Japanese in lots of my former
incarnations,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;Yuki declares it&#39;s so,
and she should know. But&mdash;&quot; here she stopped and drew
out her long, unbound yellow hair in two diaphanous, glittering
wings. &quot;The fates certainly have put my Oriental soul, this
time, into a misleading body!&quot; She was dressing now, and
stood before her pretty silver-laden bureau by a sunny south
window of the Legation.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">About two hours later of the same day Minister Todd and
his secretary, sitting alone in the thrice-guarded sanctum of
the former&#39;s private office, looked up in incredulous astonishment
as a dainty tapping betrayed a feminine guest. Then
Todd&#39;s thin smile widened. &quot;Gwennie, I&#39;ll bet!&mdash;and on
the war-path! Only that little rascal would have the cheek.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge turned away to hide the glow in his brown face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
Gwennie it proved to be. She entered, dainty, perfumed, exquisite,
in tan-cloth dress and seal-skins that exactly matched
her brows and lashes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t expect to be welcomed,&quot; she said aggressively, her
little white chin high in air. &quot;But I simply had to come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; This was from the minister.</p>

<p class="indent">Before stating her plea, Gwendolen threw a bewildering
look of entreaty upon the gloating Dodge. &quot;Dad, I can&#39;t
stand it! I haven&#39;t seen or heard anything from Yuki for a
week. Pierre Le Beau is driving me mad; and last night I
had the scariest dream about Yuki. I feel in my bones that
she needs me. Let me go to her, dad! Dearest, darlingest
diddy-daddy, say I can go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd put a loving arm about the supplicant, but at the same
time he shook his head. &quot;Can&#39;t you be patient just a little
longer, girlie? Something is bound to turn up soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Prince Haganè is in it, it will be worse than a turn-up;
it will be a heave,&quot; said Dodge, shaking his head also.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, dad, I <i>have</i> been patient. You know how I hate being
patient. I&#39;m perfectly on edge when I have to wait. Every
little bit of me begs to be cut off, and allowed to run in
scraps. Oh, don&#39;t look so solemn! I&#39;m only a girl. I can&#39;t
upset the earth. Everything has gone wrong this morning
from the minute I stepped out of bed on a tailless cat. You
can make it well, daddy. My heart simply tugs in me toward
Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At mention of her heart Dodge gave a prolonged and envious
sigh. Todd smiled, but Gwendolen only looked indignant.
Tears stood in her pretty eyes, and Dodge felt himself to be a
brute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Excellency,&quot; he said, &quot;if I might be allowed to
suggest, why not let me be Miss Todd&#39;s escort? If I am
along, I think, perhaps&mdash;&quot; He broke off with a significant
intonation. The two men exchanged glances, and the elder,
catching his chin with a characteristic gesture, walked away
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, when dad looks like that, he is going over the entire
American Constitution before he answers,&quot; cried Gwendolen,
in despair. &quot;May I not sit somewhere, Mr. Dodge?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
There were but three chairs in the room, the two revolving
desk-chairs, and one suggestively rigid and slippery, meant
for visitors. Generally, as now, it was heaped with a tottering
mass of papers. Dodge, with suspicious alacrity, leaned
forward to wheel the minister&#39;s chair. Before he could reach
it, Gwendolen had thrown herself into the other, and faced
the open vitals of his private desk.</p>

<p class="indent">In the very centre, just out of range of the minister&#39;s
eye, stood an unframed photograph of Carmen Gil y Niestra,
a languorous Spanish beauty lately arrived in Tokio. The
picture had come that morning by mail, and was only waiting
to be carried to Dodge&#39;s rooms; but Gwendolen could not
know that. She was humiliated and annoyed to feel a deep,
dry sob rise to her throat. At another time, when her best
friend was not in trouble, and she hadn&#39;t stepped on the cat,
she would have made some bright remark about it; but now
she dared not trust her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge, carefully removing the papers to the floor, seated
himself on the visitor&#39;s chair, and let his eyes rest with a
curious, half-triumphant look upon Gwendolen&#39;s downcast
face. This young man, unlike others to whom she had chosen
to show favor, had not hastened to throw himself at her feet,
pleading to be sat upon, trod upon, built upon, anything but
the one obvious suggestion that he rise and walk away. He
had never tried to take her hand; never once said that he
loved her, though the girl until this moment had felt certain
of it. Sometimes she had tried to flatter him into the declaration;
again she would pique and goad him. The result had
been the same. Dodge followed her everywhere, paid her all
possible attentions, and said everything but the one thing she
had determined to hear. With an instinctive coquette, the
desire is not so much to overcome her quarry, as to feel that
there is no quarry she cannot overcome. But even from the
seductive moonlit decks of the steamship Dodge had escaped,
uncommitted. The situation was both piquant and exciting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Dodge,&quot; said the ambassador, at length. &quot;I am
willing to take your suggestion. Is the carriage ready,
Gwen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s been at your door for hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ll let you go, since you seem to feel so set on it. But
be careful of what you say or do, and don&#39;t promise anything.
Give little Snowflake my love, and tell her I miss her about
the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen, without a word of thanks, walked toward the
door. &quot;Now, Dodge, remember,&quot; warned her father, in a
semi-whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Mr. Dodge is being sent along as a sort of diplomatic
nurse, or a keeper to an idiot, I won&#39;t have him,&quot; flashed
the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense, child!&quot; said her father. &quot;You&#39;d better run
along in a hurry before I change my mind. I don&#39;t know
but as I&#39;m weak&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without waiting for more, the girl literally ran from the
room. Clerks and visitors in the outside offices looked up in
wonder. That dry sob in her throat had stirred again. Even
her dad, on this horrid day, was cross.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside the sun had begun to shine brilliantly. The high
winds, those scourges of the Tokio winter, were, for the time,
at rest. The people in the streets appeared contented and
happy enough, trudging along on wooden clogs, or trotting
with noiseless, straw-sandalled feet between the shafts of
vehicles. The small boys wore miniature flags in their caps.</p>

<p class="indent">When again she felt mistress of her voice, she said, with an
attempt at her usual gay levity, &quot;Now, Mr. Dodge, I intend
to know what all that mysterious interchange of glances in the
office was supposed to convey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge seemed to think. &quot;I should fancy you&#39;d know by
instinct,&quot; he answered. &quot;Japan and Russia are at war.
America is neutral.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; challenged Gwendolen, &quot;and the earth goes around
the sun, and the moon around the earth. But what is that
to Yuki and to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are the daughter of the American minister, and Miss
Yuki is under the protection of Prince Haganè. It&#39;s the
bother of marriage. You must see that she can never marry
Le Beau. The worst of it all is that Le Beau&#39;s such an
ass!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t consider my friend, Mr. Le Beau, an&mdash;er&mdash;animal,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
said Gwendolen, all the more stiffly that her statement was
not quite true.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said her companion, meekly, and relapsed
into careful silence.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen fidgeted. This did not suit her mood at all.
She wanted to quarrel. &quot;Yuki and Pierre are frantically in
love, poor things! But of course an incipient diplomat
doesn&#39;t take into consideration anything so trivial as&mdash;love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge smiled into her petulant eyes, a sort of elder-brother
smile that stung her. &quot;If I am the incipient referred to,
you have missed your mark.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You pretend to be Pierre&#39;s friend, but you never did like
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When have I pretended?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are jealous because he is so good-looking. All men
are that way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t girls sometimes that way too?&quot; asked he, with
elaborate innocence.</p>

<p class="indent">The shot told. She reddened angrily. &quot;You are very
disagreeable this morning, Mr. Dodge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again fell silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; said the girl, changing her tactics swiftly. &quot;It
is I who am beastly, I know it. I&#39;m going to try now to
be good. Tell me honestly, as a friend, do you think that
Pierre has absolutely no chance of marrying Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge studied the restless eyes for sincerity before he
answered. &quot;He has a chance. If she is willing to throw
over her parents, her Emperor, and her native land, in order
to run away to him,&mdash;they may find protection. But if I
know Japanese character at all, Miss Yuki would die first&mdash;and
she ought to. The one decent thing for Le Beau is to
release her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But to run away, by night perhaps, in actual danger of
her life&mdash;oh, how romantic!&quot; sighed Gwendolen, clasping her
hands. It was done to irritate, and it succeeded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Romantic? Damfoolic!&quot; sniffed Dodge, before he could
stop himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Dodge!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
&quot;By George, it slipped out! I beg your pardon, Miss
Todd, I should not have said it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For what do you ask pardon&mdash;the expression, or the
thought?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The expression, of course. I was a mucker to use it in
your presence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I to understand that the thought underlying your
remarkable utterance is unchanged?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, er&mdash;that such a step would be foolish, and&mdash;er&mdash;unworthy?&quot;
stammered the wretched youth, now as greatly
disconcerted as even Gwendolen could wish; &quot;why, of
course I still think it. I have to think it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I approved of it openly. I demand retraction of the
thought also.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen&#39;s chance had come. Here was a bone,&mdash;a flimsy
cartilage, it is true, but still a thing to pick her quarrel over.
In the making-up she might find compensation for other recent
chagrins. Gwendolen liked to make up. The magnanimous
yielding, the condescension on her part, added to the humble
gratitude of the recipient, brought a sense of pleasant power.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You demand retraction of the thought,&quot; repeated Dodge.
He faced her slowly. She was deliberately studying the two
American flags embroidered between the blue cotton shoulders
of the carriage-driver, high on the box. The delicate profile,
uplifted in sunlight, had a translucency in the outline like
the petal of a rose. Dodge gazed with hungry heart, but deepening
frown. &quot;You didn&#39;t mean that.&quot; He said it soothingly.
&quot;You couldn&#39;t insist on anything so utterly childish as the
retraction of a personal thought. I&#39;ve apologized for the
words.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you refuse, then?&quot; said Gwendolen, with a toss of the
head she had seen Julia Marlowe give.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really mean such a thing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then&mdash;I refuse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl turned. This time it was Dodge&#39;s somewhat ragged
profile held against the sky. &quot;You dare to refuse me?&quot; she
gasped. Her hazel eyes grew inky; they seemed to shoot off
sparkles of jet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;I am at your service for everything else,&quot; he said steadily.</p>

<p class="indent">No other word was spoken until they reached the foot of
Kobinata Hill, where the betto, springing lightly to earth, preceded
the galloping horses up the slope.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know,&quot; said Dodge, slowly, &quot;this may mean to me
giving up every hope of happiness. And it&#39;s such a nasty
little cause,&mdash;like having one&#39;s eye put out by a spitball.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet you prefer it to retracting one rude, silly thought!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For God&#39;s sake!&quot; cried the badgered youth, &quot;how can a
man retract what he still thinks? Do you want me to lie, and
say I don&#39;t think a thing when I do think it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Gwendolen, with a strange glint in her face.
&quot;Lie! Say that you do not think it. I shall be satisfied
with that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be damned if I do!&quot; said Dodge. &quot;I&#39;ll lie to please
myself, but I won&#39;t lie at the bidding of another,&mdash;not even
you! Shall I stop the carriage and get out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen, with a little choking sound in her throat, turned
away. Her gesture seemed an assent. Miserably the young
man realized that he was bound by Mr. Todd to remain with
her, and overhear the conversation that might ensue. In a
moment more he helped her from the carriage in silence,
allowing her to precede him to the Onda gate, and up the
garden stones to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Suzumè answered the knock. She parted the entrance
shoji very craftily, one bent eye to the crack. Her left cheek
could not have been two inches from the floor. This gave an
uncanny look, as if a severed head, or one of those long
gourd-necked ghosts of Japanese mountains, had appeared to
receive them.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen said, &quot;Oh!&quot; and retreated. Dodge stepped forward
boldly, and put one gloved hand into the crack. The old
dame shivered at this, and seemed to cower for a spring. A
swift, soft rush of feet came through the house, and Yuki,
flinging both doors wide, sent a crooked smile toward them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come quickly,&quot; she panted; &quot;I pray you wait not to
remove the shoes. My father is absent. I have prayed for
Gwendolen; there is great thing to be said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge shut his teeth together. He was to be needed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
Without a look for him, Gwendolen, obeying Yuki&#39;s injunction
as to shoes, sprang up the one stone doorstep and followed
Yuki along a dim corridor. Dodge, more deliberately,
motioned Suzumè to remove his shoes, standing first on one
foot, then on the other, and balancing himself by the aid of a
shoji frame. The untying of shoestrings was a difficult task
for excited old fingers. Her beady eyes darted incessantly
back into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No harm can be done. I am from the American Legation,
and was sent to accompany Miss Todd,&quot; said he, in Japanese,
pitying the old dame&#39;s nervousness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai! hai! Sayo de gozaimasuka?&quot; mumbled she, greatly
relieved. She loved and was proud of Yuki; she adored her
mistress; but there was a single voice in that house, and it
belonged to Tetsujo.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge went alone into the house, guiding himself by the
voices. They had reached the guest-room. All fusuma and
shoji had been closed. Without knocking Dodge pushed aside
a silver panel painted with birds. At the same moment Iriya
entered by the opposite wall of the room, a mere white ghost
of propriety.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, almost in Gwendolen&#39;s arms, was pouring out rapid,
disjointed, incorrect phrases of English,&mdash;sometimes with a
whole sentence in her own tongue,&mdash;so that the listener could
catch the meaning only in fragments.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge, after a bow to Mrs. Onda, walked straight to Yuki,
took a seat near her, and by his quiet eyes compelled her attention.
He began to speak in slow, deliberate Japanese that the
mother also might understand. Whether interpreting through
his careful pronouncing or divining from his emphasis, Gwendolen,
too, seemed to follow him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In allowing Miss Todd to call this morning, Miss Onda,
her father, Minister Todd, has commissioned me to say to
you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you believe him!&quot; cried Gwendolen, flinging herself
bodily before Yuki. She turned flashing eyes upon the
speaker. &quot;The poor child has enough to bear already, without
your giving more!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must deliver your father&#39;s message, Miss Todd. And I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
shall do so, though I have to wait until Miss Onda&#39;s father
comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At sound of that dreaded name Gwendolen&#39;s courage for the
moment fell. Dodge quietly resumed, in Japanese, &quot;While
Mr. and Mrs. Todd have only the most affectionate feelings
toward Miss Onda, they beg to recall the very delicate international
questions raised by the present war. America being
neutral&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Todd&#39;s official position&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Todd&#39;s official fiddlestrings,&quot; interrupted Gwendolen.
&quot;There, Yuki! He&#39;s through! That&#39;s all he had to say!
Now can&#39;t we go into your bedroom, or out to the garden, and
finish our conversation in peace?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendolen, dear,&mdash;no!&quot; said Yuki, pressing her hand.
&quot;It is most terribly serious time with all. I am glad to have
Mr. Dodge here; he will not prevent any help,&mdash;he will give
it. I must now relate, Mr. Dodge,&quot; she went on, very brave
and self-possessed, &quot;the new, strange circumstance&mdash;&quot; Suddenly
she flushed the color of a peony, dropped her face in her
hands, and murmured to Gwendolen, &quot;Yes, you must say
it, Gwendolen. It is such immodest things for Japanese
girl to speak! You tell him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not sure that I understand very clearly myself,&quot; said
Gwendolen, with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya stared on, white, motionless, unsmiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As far as I can make the trouble out,&quot; said Gwendolen,
flinging her words to Dodge, rather than speaking them,
&quot;Prince Haganè backs Yuki&#39;s father, utterly, against Pierre.
They won&#39;t consider the possibility of her ever marrying him.
Worst of all, while her heart is sore with this, they are
trying to force her into marriage with some rich old man,&mdash;some
influential relative, I believe, of Haganè. Isn&#39;t he a
relative, Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o! He is not the relative,&quot; said Yuki, from behind
sheltering hands. &quot;It is himself&mdash;he&mdash;the Prince Haganè!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prince Haganè! Prince Sanètomo Haganè?&quot; cried Dodge,
in incredulous surprise. &quot;Good Lord! Why, he&#39;s the biggest
man in this kingdom, next to the Emperor and the Crown
Prince! Has&mdash;has he made your father a formal offer of
marriage for you, Miss Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
Yuki nodded &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old sport! So this has been his game,&quot; muttered
Gwendolen to herself.</p>

<p class="indent">At the full name of Haganè, a wintry smile of pride had
flashed into Iriya&#39;s set face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whe-e-ew!&quot; whistled Dodge, again. He could not get
this wonder fixed. &quot;I see now why your family is wound up
like a spring, Miss Yuki. It&#39;s a superlative opportunity
for you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen sat so still that first Yuki, then Dodge, stared
at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it you think I can do with Pierre for you, Yuki?&quot;
asked the American girl, in a voice as strange as her silence.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki was slightly disconcerted. &quot;Only, dear, that I want
to be sure the truth is known to Mr. Le Beau. I would have
more peace to feel that he knows correctly. And he then will
understand why I cannot write to him, or see him, or answer
when he sings the song of Carmen I told you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You intend then to hold to Pierre, and throw over Prince
Haganè, no matter what the consequences?&quot; asked Gwendolen,
curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know not about &#39;throw over.&#39; It sounds a disrespectful
word to so great a man. But I am bound to Pierre, as you
know, by the promise.&quot; Again her face flushed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll wager your father does not consider that promise
binding,&quot; put in Dodge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not my father, and not Prince Haganè,&quot; said Yuki,
simply. &quot;But then, you know, they is not me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;er&mdash;presume not,&quot; answered he, absently.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that the conversation was all in English, the pale
effigy of Iriya did not even turn its eyes from one face to the
other. It was her duty to her husband to be present, and so
she remained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Yuki!&quot; flashed out the young man, with new animation.
&quot;You haven&#39;t asked my advice, and you may not desire
it. But let me say one thing. It seems awful to me,&mdash;even
though I am an American, and can&#39;t know all the fine points of
Japanese feeling,&mdash;to throw over a chance like this for a
Frenchman! Is he worth it&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
&quot;How would it seem if you were in the place of Pierre Le
Beau?&quot; cried Gwendolen, angrily, before Yuki could speak.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese girl evidently was glad of the question.
&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; she repeated. &quot;How would you be?&quot; She
hung on his answer.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man&#39;s eyes were cool, his voice crisp and convincing,
as he said slowly, &quot;In the first place, I could not
imagine myself having forced any binding promise from a girl
so far from her home and friends. I might have let her see
I loved her,&mdash;a fellow can&#39;t always help that; but I wouldn&#39;t
have tied her up in her own words until she had the backing
of her own people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen was all ready with a scornful word, but Yuki&#39;s
small ice-cold hand upon her wrist restrained her. Yuki was
leaning toward the young man, an eager gleam in her eyes.
&quot;Mr. Dodge, what was it that you meant by the su-per-lative
opportunity&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I seem to be turned into a sort of Information Bureau on
other people&#39;s morals to-day,&quot; smiled Dodge. &quot;But this is
an easy one. I meant just what a Japanese would mean,&mdash;a
rousing good chance for patriotism. Isn&#39;t that what you
thought?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s face fell, and her lips trembled. &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered
like a child. &quot;That is Japanese thought.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How lofty and superior! A Confucius come to judgment!&quot;
cried Gwendolen to Dodge. His calmness, his power
of thought, so soon after their fatal quarrel, irritated her. It
almost seemed to make light of her influence. Since she
could not command, she wished at least to sting him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And, Yuki, now <i>I</i> have advice to give. If I loved
Pierre as you do,&mdash;if I loved any man so that the thought of
another turned me sick,&mdash;I&#39;d be faithful to him until those
old moat pines turned somersaults and came up again as grass!
I&#39;d marry him, though Jimmu Tenno, with a new sword and
mirror, came down to prevent! You say that Pierre goes by
here whistling. What&#39;s to hinder you from going to him?
The women here would not prevent. Some time like this,
when your father is absent,&mdash;mind, I don&#39;t advise the doing
it,&mdash;only, I say, if you were tortured and driven to despair&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
Yuki stopped her by a gesture. &quot;Even that terrible thought
has been thinked by me. But even if I wished it,&mdash;go to
those garden shoji, Gwendolen. Open with some noisiness,
and see what occurs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen obeyed with vehemence, placing one still booted
foot defiantly upon the veranda. Instantly, as if by magic,
the two blue-clad gardeners crouched, in threatening attitudes,
on the gravelled path below. At sight of the tall blonde girl
the men literally froze into grizzled gargoyles. Gwendolen
drew back with a cry, then instantly realized the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Vile spies!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Hired assassins! If there
were a man here, he would drown you in that pond! Go
away! Shoo!&quot; she shrieked at the astonished natives.
Without a word, they exchanged slow, wondering glances,
nodded, and withdrew.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen slammed the shoji together again. &quot;No wonder
you are pale, Yuki,&quot; she said, her voice trembling with excitement
and indignation; &quot;I never dreamed anybody would
dare a thing like this!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how intensely romantic!&quot; remarked Dodge, in a low
voice, to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki did not try to answer. Her head drooped lower, lower,
with each instant. Tears were coming in uncontrollable
throbs to eyes that had, through deeper troubles, remained
dry. This humiliation before friends of another world touched
some secret personal spring of pride. She lifted first one gray
sleeve, then the other, apologizing in low, broken sentences
for the vulgarity of thus displaying grief. Gwendolen threw
herself to the floor beside her friend, her own bright eyes becoming
springs of sorrow. Dodge rose, standing helplessly
near, and wishing himself somewhere else.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon this lachrymosal tableau entered Tetsujo Onda, and
stood for a moment incredulous, in the parted fusuma, like
some image of Ojin Tenno, the God of War, a scowl carved
deep in his brow. Gwendolen first caught sight of him.
Rising to her knees, she tried by looks to wither him away.
She might as well have blown seed-arrows from an iron dandelion.
Dodge, the diplomat, rushed gallantly to the fore.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-morning, Mr. Onda,&quot; he began, bowing spasmodically.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;Fine morning, isn&#39;t it? We were just making a
little call in the neighborhood, and ran in to see your wife and
daughter,&mdash;foreign custom, you know!&mdash;and the young
ladies have to talk and weep sometimes over their happy, vanished
school days!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ugh!&quot; grunted the unwilling host, scantily returning one
of the many bows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just so&mdash;just so,&quot; said Dodge, with increasing cordiality.
&quot;And now we must bid you good day. Miss Todd and I were
just on the point of starting. This is the daughter&mdash;the only
child, you know&mdash;of the new American minister to Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know of her, and you, and the Frenchman, and much
else,&quot; said Onda, with a disconcerting warp of the lips meant
for a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go! If you love me, make quick goings,&quot; whispered Yuki,
with her arms around Gwendolen&#39;s neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With nothing settled&mdash;no appointment for you and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is hopeless,&quot; put in Yuki, instantly. &quot;Mention no
name! They will guard me now much closer. Oh, it&#39;s my
father&#39;s doing, not Haganè; he is noble!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I will see&mdash;the other, and tell him clearly. How
shall I let you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A telegram. No one will keep that from me. Send it in
English,&mdash;in hard words, you understand! And, oh, Gwendolen,
send it to-morrow before twilight. Pray for me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ignoring Tetsujo&#39;s increasing rage, Yuki followed her friend
to the very door, pausing for a last embrace. &quot;You are my
good friend&mdash;my golden friend! Nothing between our hearts
can ever come. Ne?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never! Never! Ne?&quot; answered Gwendolen, trying to
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki turned, and went back as a prisoner to an inky cell.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Out on the street, at the carriage-step, two pleasing Americans
paused, and eyed each other much with the expression of
a pair of young game-cocks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; said the tan-colored fowl, superbly, &quot;why do you
hesitate? Is it to beg paw-don of some one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg paw-don?&quot; echoed the other, in mild surprise. &quot;No,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
certainly not! How could you fawncy such a thing? Do
<i>you</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen, with a muffled exclamation, sprang unaided into
the carriage. &quot;Go on! Hurry up! American Legation&mdash;Koshikwan,
I mean! This beastly lingo&mdash;&quot; she cried to the
driver, and so far forgot herself as to prod him in the American
flags.</p>

<p class="indent">The startled servant looked down and over her, to Dodge,
for confirmation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all right, betto!&quot; said Dodge, airily, in Japanese. &quot;I
prefer walking back. Take the august young lady home by a
long, long road! She has become honorably overheated!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen gave the speaker one helpless glare, threw herself
back in the seat, and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge stood in the middle of the road, looking after the
carriage until bamboo hedges closed in upon it, and the noises
of its rattling wheels faded into the myriad sounds of the city
below him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> month of March was at hand. Tempestuous winds
howled and whirled in the pine and camphor trees, in the
flame-like, springing bamboo groves, and under temple eaves.
The air was full of petals and scraps of green. Sometimes a
tiny flake of flint stung the face, and between the teeth an
uncomfortable grit blew in. Angry gray clouds piled high
from the north, westward from the Atlantic, eastward from
that &quot;rough and black&quot; water we call the Yellow Sea. The
very firmament was in torment. The wind, combated at once
by many currents, tore at times great eddies in the gray, letting
the sun down in avalanches of light. Yuki saw the
shadow and the sun pass, like fleeting ghosts, across the garden;
felt the chill and warmth alternating in their wakes.
The wind tossed cruelly the branches of cherry-trees, where
sharp-pointed buds in clusters, just showing a first hint
of pink, were set. The plum-tree was bare but for a few
timid green leaves. Now and then a twig or branch snapped,
and fell sharply on the gravelled pathway, where instantly
one of the blue-robed gardeners advanced to pick it up.</p>

<p class="indent">In the cowed house Yuki moved like some waxen automaton,
living only in the one sense of hearing. Every cry from
the street, every wind-jangle of the gate-bell, sent her currents
of hope and apprehension. Tetsujo grimly ignored the intensifying
strain, but Iriya&#39;s pitying eyes turned more often
to her child. The servants kept to themselves, whispering
and exchanging glances.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the bamboo hedges which shut out the main street-line
bent over, at times almost to the earth, writhing, stretching,
and squeaking at the confining strips of wood that sought to
hold them erect. Besides the hedge-bamboo, &quot;sa-sa,&quot; the
fence had an inner line of cruel orange-thorn.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
Yuki had watched the elemental conflict greedily. Suddenly
a snatch of Carmen&#39;s love-song rode the wind. It was
the sound she had expected. Her little hands sought each
other within the silken sleeves, and clutched so fiercely that
a nail snapped. Again came the song, nearer this time, just
without the gate. It was a strange, incongruous note, as if
an English lark should rise from the bruised and battered
hedge. Yuki heard a movement in the next room, where Tetsujo
sat among his books. Perhaps it was coincidence that
Suzumè brought her, exactly at this moment, a fresh tray of
tea. The blue gardeners strolled together into full view, and
stooped, as if to discuss the condition of a botan bush, now
beaten down.</p>

<p class="indent">Square upon the back of one of them fell a queer winged
missive, a scrap of foreign paper weighted with a pebble.
Yuki saw it clearly. Old Suzumè, with a stifled gasp,
crouched in her place. The girl poured tea for herself, and
drank it calmly. The pelted gardener, without so much
as a look around, lifted the scrap of paper as if it had
been a broken bud, and slipped it, weight and all, into his
sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">The Carmen song stopped. Suzumè, with a last sly glance,
slipped from the room. Yuki pressed one hand to her throat.
It would be no harm to sing the answering strain. What
though her father and her jailers heard? If once the song
sped forth, not even their craft could recall it. Pierre would
understand, then, that she heard, but was a prisoner; that even
the written note he threw could not be received. Once, twice,
the white lips parted, and the slender throat stiffened for an
answering phrase; but no sound came. It was as in nightmare
dreams, where one seeks to cry aloud, and finds that the
voice is gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Now her father was on his feet. She heard his long, swinging
stride go through the house. At the door she heard
him kick his wooden clogs, and give a gruff order to O Maru
San. Then the harsh scraping feet passed along the garden
stones, the little bell clamored, and the gate-panel closed with
a bang.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ma-a-a!&quot; she heard old Suzumè cry. &quot;This is not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
master I have known for fifty years. He must be bewitched
by a fox.&quot; Maru gave a little giggle, which the elder woman
quickly suppressed. Iriya, in the guest-room, moved like a
cat. Yuki knew that all were against her,&mdash;spies, enemies.
Passages from the Psalms of her Christian Bible came to the
girl. &quot;They compass me round about on every side. I am
set in the midst of snares.&quot; She ran out into the garden, now,
listening for sounds of violence from the street. Nothing
came but the wailing of wind. Tetsujo returned as abruptly
as he had gone. Yuki, steeling herself against the look of
aversion certain to be met, went before him, not questioning,
but searching his face with haggard eyes for some possible
sign of at least a will-conflict between him and Pierre. She
fancied, in her abnormal state of mind, that something of
Pierre&#39;s thought must cling to his enemy, and so be transmitted
to her. But Tetsujo&#39;s face was as blank and expressionless
as the glazed side of one of Suzumè&#39;s tea-jars on the
kitchen shelf.</p>

<p class="indent">Unable to breathe longer that overweighted air, Yuki caught
up a gray shawl from her room, and went boldly out again into
the garden. The rain had ceased entirely. The wind, though
fiercer when it came, came at increasing intervals. Through
one of these temporary lulls Yuki reached the bleak little
pond. The encircling rocks appeared older, grimmer, and more
shrunken. A few of the bordering plants had been twisted
and split. One was overturned, its ochre roots clutching at
the unfriendly air, the evergreen branches plunged deep into
quivering gray water.</p>

<p class="indent">As if in wonder that so frail a creature as a girl should dare
its strength, the storm, crouching and growling for a last
effort, hurled the full bulk of its viewless majesty upon her.
She was beaten bodily upon the rocks. But for the protecting
shawl she might have been blinded, or the long black hair torn
from her. For an instant breath stopped; but in the wake of
it came exultation. Lifting her head, she smiled a challenge
to the storm to snatch her faint soul from her lips, and bear it
far, like a petal, on that streaming tide of heaven. The blue-robed
gardeners, crouching in the shelter of a rock, stared at
her in wonder. Iriya&#39;s face came for one white instant to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
the veranda and vanished. Yuki could hear the very timbers
groan. The bands of dead bamboo, lashed in horizontal strips
to the living hedge, squeaked and buckled, and squeaked again,
in absurd imitation of animate torture. In the pond the
pear-shaped water was smitten into one gelatinous, cowering
mass.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the wind went. Sounds all about her of stress
and terror changed into whimpers, whispers, moans, and small
complainings. The pond-water sprang up in small simultaneous
waves which all pawed and clamored at the rooks for
explanation. Yuki stood upright, realizing dully her slow return
to sanity and poise. The storm had swept her, for a
moment, out of her own reach. In the recoil she grudged her
soul its habitation.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the nonchalant gardeners crossed her path, making
respectful salutation in transit. Her eyes followed them
absently, but all at once became glued to a small sagging
point in the left sleeve of the shorter man. As they disappeared
around the corner plum-tree, she sank to one of the
rocks. As if she had not enough to bear already, without the
torture of speculation on the purport of those written words
she was never to see! Her hands fell limp, her head sank.
The gray shawl crept by unnoticed inches to the earth.</p>

<p class="indent">Wearily the girl opened the portals of her thought to the
same hopeless throng of shrouded visitors,&mdash;conjectures, all
of them, moving solemnly one behind the other,&mdash;creatures
without a face,&mdash;half-animate forms with no clear direction
or purpose except to move on. What was to be the end of it
all, for her? There was no answer to that. Tetsujo apparently
would neither disown her nor relinquish his determination
to marry her quickly. It did not seem much to ask,
only to be let alone; and yet in some strange way this had
come to be a priceless, impossible boon. Pierre&#39;s note she
would never see. She had not been able to answer his Carmen
song. One way alone remained open for communication, and
that was Gwendolen&#39;s telegram. She had faith that, in some
way, this would get to her. At the cry, &quot;Dempo!&quot; she had
determined to rush out in person and demand it. Even though
this succeeded, she could not fix great hope on its content.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
Surely no thought would come to Pierre but the old loving,
desperate, appealing cry, &quot;Be true, be faithful, and we may
yet find happiness!&quot; How the foreigners harped upon that
thought of personal happiness! It was, to most of them, the
one definite aim in life. To Pierre&mdash;dear, beautiful, joyous
Pierre&mdash;it was life itself. A Japanese is taught from childhood
to look upon happiness as the casual flower of his evergreen
garden,&mdash;the lotos on a still pond of duty. It is never
an incentive, never in itself a conscious reward. She had tried
to teach Pierre this, but he had laughed at her, and said it was
because Japanese did not know how to love.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki fixed thoughtful eyes on a small shrivelled tuft of fern
near her feet. Its once graceful fronds were cruelly bruised
and twisted, first by frost, and now by this pitiless storm. &quot;I
know how it feels,&quot; thought Yuki. &quot;My father&#39;s harshness,
my mother&#39;s suffering, and my own desire to be faithful have
so wrung and bruised my heart.&quot; After a pause she said
aloud, &quot;I wonder if it thinks itself really dead?&quot; She
stooped down slowly, and parted the sodden, clinging scraps
of brown. In the heart a nest of tiny leaflets curled, like
baby glow-worms, close wrapped in silky filaments of down.
They seemed to shrink from her icy fingers, as if to say:
&quot;Let us be still! We are only asleep. Those tattered brown
bed-curtains keep us warm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki stood upright again. The expression of her face was
altered, and her eyes now slowly softened into tears. &quot;My
poor Pierre! my poor Pierre!&quot; she whispered. &quot;If he were
just a little more noble, if he were a Japanese, he would say,
&#39;It is best that you should obey your parents, and serve at
once your native land.&#39; But he will not say it! And I have
promised!&quot; She leaned over for another moment, heaping
the dead fern-leaves above their sleeping youth, then walked
slowly to the house.</p>

<p class="indent">One star, at least, shone clear in her troubled firmament.
If Pierre should, through Gwendolen&#39;s intercession, or through
some awakened vision of his own, telegraph, urging her to be
true to her better self, no matter what the grief to her plighted
love,&mdash;then she could wish to marry that great man, Haganè,
to pay her filial debt to the now stricken parents, to show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
her love and loyalty to Nippon! Of course there was no
hope that Pierre would do this; but if he should,&mdash;if he
should&mdash;!</p>

<p class="indent">The wind came again and again, but never so terribly as for
that one moment by the pond. Ordinary sounds of domestic
life arose from the Onda household, and from the neighbors
around it. Cocks began to crow, as if the storm-clearing was
of their own contrivance; sparrows chirped. The white tailless
cat picked a dainty way along the outer edges of bamboo
gutters. Cries of belated peddlers came cheerily from the
street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-o-fu-u! To-o-fu-u-u!&quot; called the bean-curd man,
with his characteristic upward inflection on the last syllable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Chi-chee! Ichiban chi-chee!&quot; cried the milk-peddler, trotting
between the shafts of his small, closed cart. He was
very proud of this cart, and because of it considered himself
the most aristocratic kitchen-visitor on the hill. Its color was
a loud, blasphemous blue. On the sides, in letters of yellow
edged with black, were two inscriptions. The first, in Chinese
ideographs, announced prompt delivery of the richest and
freshest milk. Below it, in English, glowed the startling
line, &quot;Fresh Ox-Milk Every Hours.&quot; Suzumè had long been
a patron of the blue cart. A little thin-necked milk-bottle
dangled, now empty, by a bit of white cord, just without the
gate. This the milk-boy removed, substituting one that was
full, though equally stopperless.</p>

<p class="indent">The soba-ya (buckwheat-man), lurching and skimming along
under a bent kiri-wood pole that bore at one end a chest of
drawers and at the other a steaming furnace with bowls,
copper-pots, and a ladle, naturally had little voice left for
vociferous proclamation. His coming was indicated, at long
range, by the click and shiver of copper drawer-handles beating
in unison against half-filled boxes. According to the
quantity of dry buckwheat in each drawer, the handle uttered
a different note. Needless to say, this burdened hawker loitered
long at each gate; but at the Onda entrance he stayed
longest of all. It was Maru&#39;s happy privilege to bargain with
these several venders. Her heart found an answering thump
and shiver as the soba-ya drew near.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
&quot;Honorably steamed, or augustly raw, O maiden of the
lovely countenance?&quot; asked he of the blushing one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Augustly boiled, to-day, kind sir,&mdash;if you can graciously
condescend to bestow the amount of two sens&#39; worth,&quot; rejoined
Maru, sucking in her breath with ceremonious emphasis as she
presented a small green bowl.</p>

<p class="indent">This flirtation was already becoming talked of in the neighborhood.
More than one curious &quot;ba-san&quot; (old woman),
relieved by age from personal domestic cares, sought peepholes
and crannies in neighboring hedges when the smell of
buckwheat warmed the air.</p>

<p class="indent">The buckwheat man bestowed an encouraging smile. &quot;The
noblest of my customers invariably prefer my worthless viands
honorably boiled,&quot; said he, with a side glance from under the
brim of his malachite Derby.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As for that, you, by preparing so deliciously the delectable
food, make buying necessary,&quot; simpered the purchaser with a
rosier glow.</p>

<p class="indent">A slim and seemingly boneless cur, who also had nostrils
for hot buckwheat, scraped a stealthy way along the hedge
toward them. He felt that the flirtation might have possibilities
for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;D&#333;-mo!&quot; said the peddler, with deprecating nods. &quot;The
stuff is poor, I fear. It is but your divine condescension and
pitying heart that make you encourage me.&quot; He lifted the
copper lid of his cauldron, and began ladling out a goodly portion
of the slippery ware.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is the mad young foreigner with yellow hair who
now haunts the foot of this hill?&quot; asked the peddler, during
his precarious occupation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ma-a!&quot; cried Maru under her breath. She craned her
neck to look furtively up and down the street, and then asked
in a confidential whisper, &quot;Is there indeed such a person at
the foot of this august hill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I speak simple truth. Surely you know of him. In all
the roads he is to be seen. He moves so quickly the children
say there are two of him. They cry at his approach, though
he flings them many rin and sen, and hide faces in their
mothers&#39; sleeves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
&quot;Repeat it not from me,&quot; cautioned Maru. &quot;Aunt Suzumè
would surely scorch me with her pipe, should she hear me
gossiping. But he is a grand foreigner, son of a king, who is
wild with love to marry our Miss Yuki; but she repels him,
for she is asked in marriage by a much greater person, of
Japan,&mdash;a very, very great prince!&quot; Maru swelled her fat
chest like a pigeon. The interest in her auditor&#39;s face thrilled
her. She opened her mouth for further revelations, when a
sneeze from the kitchen brought her caution. &quot;I&mdash;I dare
not tell his name,&quot; she added weakly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are honorably to be commended for your prudence,&quot;
gravely declared the soba-ya, though he was swallowing hard
this lump of disappointment. &quot;Prudence is an excellent
quality, particularly in a wife. Is it true&mdash;er&mdash;ahem!&mdash;is
it true, small round one, that the ancient dame who presides
over the kitchen of your noble household is, indeed, your one
surviving relative?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Te-he-he!&quot; giggled little Maru in blissful discomfort.
&quot;She truly is, O most worthy sir,&mdash;but why should you wish
to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Much reason is existent,&quot; said the other, with such meaning
that Maru, after an enraptured gasp, let the entire contents
of the bowl tilt, and then fall with a wet thud to the
earth. The white cur, having well calculated his chances,
reaped the reward of intelligence if not of virtue, and went
down the hill with a yelp of joy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kwannon help me!&quot; cried the girl at this catastrophe.
&quot;For this a great beating may be honorably bestowed upon
me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, maiden, be calm!&quot; said the gallant youth. &quot;Free
of charge will I restore it. Give me the bowl!&quot; Tremblingly
she did so. Their fingers met beneath the sage-green rim.
Maru&#39;s round face glowed more like a peony than ever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maru! Ma-<i>roo</i>!&quot; came a voice from within. &quot;Is the
buckwheat-man boiling you, that so long you remain? Worthless
vagabond! Let him leave at once!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is Aunt Suzumè! I must go! Again to-morrow you
will augustly pause at our broken-down step, will you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Though in the night I should make divine retirement, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
to-morrow at this hour would my ghost return to bring your
buckwheat!&quot; protested the swain. With one more gasp of
ecstasy, and the crossing of two pairs of small slanting eyes,
the lovers separated. A moment later the peculiar click and
chitter of the metal handles came back through dying gusts of
wind.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Tetsujo, immediately after luncheon, returned to his book-room,
where now he spent all his waking hours. After some
indeterminate search among his well-worn favorites, he took
down a volume of Toemmei&#39;s poems, a venerable old Chinese
classic, and began to read aloud. Iriya, in the kitchen, had
already begun to discuss the evening meal. Yuki sat, listlessly,
with folded hands, in her own room, next to the library.
Her one thought now was to hear the cry &quot;Dempo!&quot; which
should announce the coming of Gwendolen&#39;s telegram. To
look out upon an indefinite period of such days as these was
almost more than the girl&#39;s brave spirit could endure. Yet, to
Pierre she had given an oath. She had let him break the long
hairpin. If he commanded her &quot;Be firm and true,&quot; she would
be true, no matter what came!</p>

<p class="indent">Through these dark, monotonous thoughts, her father&#39;s
voice, low, rich, and sonorous, with the jerky melodic chant
and rhythm imposed by long reading aloud of Chinese literature,
flowed up and finally compelled her. So had she been
taught to read in childhood, before her long sojourn in a
foreign land.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Let me now return, for my farm and garden are growing
wild! As the boat skims lightly along the water, the wind
plays with my sleeves. O boatman! how far yet to my home?
So far, and yet the hour so late! Now, now at last I see my
own loved gate, and enter with joyous rush.&#39;&quot; The deep tones
rose as in triumph, then sank again to infinite tenderness.
&quot;&#39;The paths to my steps are growing up wild with grass, but
the pine and the chrysanthemums still flourish. With my children
in my arms I enter the house, drink a refreshing draught,
and gaze, and gaze again at the shadows under the garden trees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Return! Return! Why should I not return? Let me
renounce the intercourse and pleasure of the world! Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
me and the world renounce each other! There is nothing
more for me to derive from the world!&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The farmers come in and tell me that spring is approaching.
There are rumors of war in the West. But why should
they interfere with my rambles? The trees put on a smile
and begin to bud. The streams look busy and begin to flow.
What joy to see all things fall due at their season! And yet
I am reminded that my season, too, is almost come. Alas!
The lodging of man in this Inn of the Universe is but for a
single season!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s hands were pressed against her breast. In the
samurai&#39;s slow, fervid utterance one could feel each word fill
and thrill the heroic heart before utterance came to the lips.
He was deriving strength and comfort from the immortal
ode. &quot;&#39;Commit then, O soul, thyself upon the current of
things!&#39;&quot; rose the exulting pæan. &quot;&#39;Let me choose my own
time. Let me go out for my solitary walk! Let me hobble
about the farm on my friendly cane. Let me toil up the
Eastern hill, look the clear brook in the face, and sing it my
dying songs. So let me end my days as days of themselves
may end. So shall my joy flow on with the eternal will of
Heaven!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki sat upright, her wide eyes fixed, as it were, upon the
viewless flight of echo. &quot;And they of the Western world say
that my people have no true religion, no deep belief. Their
souls crawl, where ours take wings! Nippon, Nippon, my
country!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The magnificence of her nation&#39;s past, the heroism, self-sacrifice
inherent in her countrymen, the passionate craving
for what is spiritual and sublime, the belief in watchful
spirits of dead ancestors, in the divinity and guidance of dead
Emperors manifest in the living flesh, came in a flood and
bore up the girl&#39;s spirit in a tide of light. What were foreign
education, foreign friendship, foreign pledges,&mdash;love itself,&mdash;to
a girl of Yamato Damashii? She was Japanese, one small
animate cell in a living tissue of race. To serve her country,
that, indeed, should be life&#39;s worth. &quot;Pierre, Pierre,&quot; she
sobbed. &quot;I shall not bring you joy, nor can you give to
me the duty that it is my part to bear. Let me go, dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
one, let me go, and pray to our Christian God that your
kisses fade from me, and your blue eyes be turned away. If
I were only myself I would die, or defy for you everything.
But I am not myself; I am what my ancestors, my parents
and my country have made me; I am only one shivering mote
of dust in my country&#39;s shining destiny. Let me go, my
dear; Kwannon will bless you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Slow, helpful tears began to course, unfelt, along her white
cheeks. All at once the physical exhaustion of long, sleepless
nights and days unendurable began to tell on her. The
glossy head bent over, lower and lower. Tetsujo, after a long
pause, had begun an heroic epic of the Heiké clan. The
words were indistinct, a sort of splendid blur. She had an
impression of horses, arms, war-shouts, and of fluttering banners
on distant hills. Then all sounds began to die away.
She smiled faintly, and stretched out her slender young limbs
upon the soft matting. Soon she was asleep, with the long,
regular breaths of childhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Without stirring, she remained in the unconscious pose for
hours. Iriya, peeping in upon her, choked back a little sob
of thanksgiving, and turned away to kneel, in her room,
before the ancestral shrine. Lights burned here always, and
the pleasant aroma of fresh tea was seldom absent. With
hands struck very softly together, that the sleeper should not
be disturbed, Iriya supplicated the gods of her home and of
her nation that the child should be given clearer vision. A
European would have demanded personal happiness for her
daughter. The Japanese soul sees deeper, and asks, as the
highest boon, power to carry out, in this life, that which
has been decreed, and so, for the future, to achieve a nobler
attitude.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Just at the hour of twilight Iriya returned, and kneeling,
called softly, &quot;Yuki-ko&mdash;my heart&#39;s treasure&mdash;you must
awake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki sat upright instantly. &quot;Has the dempo come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Iriya, presenting a pink sealed missive. &quot;And
in the guest-room waits Prince Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki tore the telegram apart, threw open the shoji for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
more light, and read: &quot;Find it impossible to do anything
with P no logic or reason pathetic but a child we all think
case hopeless forever in your place would accept H whatever
happens I am your loving faithful G.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a terribly long message to come in such an expensive
way. Surely it is from a foreigner,&quot; ventured Iriya.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long has it been here, mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya showed embarrassment. &quot;Since about noon, I believe.
Suzumè honorably received it and gave it to her master, as
she was bid. Your father would not let you have it now,
but that Prince Haganè took it from his hands and sent it.
He says you are to read and consider it; also that you must
not hasten. What marvellous kindness he always shows,
that great man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki rose slowly. &quot;He is great and kind. Give thanks
to him, my mother, and say that I shall enter within a few
moments.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya prepared to leave. She had searched her daughter&#39;s
eyes for a loving recognition, but in vain. On the threshold
she wavered. &quot;My baby,&mdash;my only one!&quot; she cried aloud
brokenly, and held out her arms. In an instant, before Yuki
could respond, she closed the fusuma and ran toward the
guest-room.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Prince Haganè</span> sat in the place of honor, his back to
the tokonoma, where new flowers bloomed and incense perfumed
the space. His robes, of the usual magnificent quality
of silk, had to-night a deep bronze color. The candles, placed
one on each side of him, threw down a yellow light, which
took the wrinkles from his scarred face and some of the sadness
from his mouth. To Tetsujo&#39;s feasting eyes he appeared
as a god; not the meek, forgiving Buddha whom women
and children adore, but some splendid old war-god of Shinto
tradition, young with the immortality of youth, yet old as the
world in wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">The outer shoji stood well apart, letting in the chill, wet
sweetness of the night. The storm had now quite died away.
The air of the room was so still that the candle-flames stood
like balanced flakes of topaz, and the white smoke of the burning
incense hung like a silver cord from the gloom above.</p>

<p class="indent">The moment that Yuki entered, Haganè, with his trained
vision, saw that some great spiritual change had taken place.
The look of miserable defiance he feared was not there. Iriya
had waited for her. The two women advanced to the great
visitor, and bowed before him three times, then went back
modestly to the far end of the room. Suzumè brought fresh
tea, and two new balls of charcoal for the hibachi. As the
servant left, Iriya asked of her husband, &quot;Shall I also withdraw?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is according to our lord&#39;s will,&quot; answered Tetsujo, his
eyes turning to the prince.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would you prefer, Yuki-ko?&quot; Haganè&#39;s voice was
kind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should prefer my mother to remain,&quot; answered Yuki,
without hesitation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
&quot;Madame Onda, I beg you to honor us with your presence,&quot;
said Haganè, with a slight bow.</p>

<p class="indent">Onda Tetsujo frowned. If his loyal nature allowed him to
make one criticism of his daimyo, it was of a certain lax, foreign
politeness toward women. The fault seemed to increase
with years. Whether Prince Haganè suspected this disapprobation
or not, on this occasion at least he made no attempt to
modify it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have come in person, little Yuki-ko, to hear your thought.
No, do not speak yet!&quot; he interpolated, with a slight lifting
of the right hand. &quot;Wait until I give you questions to answer!
At the beginning there must be quiet discussion between
us four, with no haste or opposition on the part of&mdash;any.&quot;
He looked, with these last words, directly at his old
retainer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Lord, my Lord!&quot; fumed Tetsujo, &quot;shall I be able to
contain myself while you condescend to bandy words with a
mere girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I command it, I think you will contain yourself,&quot; said
the prince, easily. Tetsujo rocked on the matting, gripped
his arms tightly, and was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The gods seem to have decreed no happiness for me in
marriage,&quot; said Haganè, impersonally, to all. &quot;Perhaps they
have only new mockery in store, if now, in my old age, I dare
take to myself this fair flower. Yet am I tempted; by the
good for her, as it seems to me; by my friendship for you,
Onda Tetsujo; and by the need for an official mistress of my
house. I can give her unusual opportunity to serve Nippon,
as in my letter I wrote.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya, in her corner, put her face to the floor. &quot;My Lord,
even that you have thought it, makes richer the traditions of
our house&mdash;through ten succeeding generations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would not have the child consent because of family
honors, my good dame,&quot; said Haganè, a little sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I speak now, Lord?&quot; asked Yuki, in her sweet,
steady voice. Tetsujo ground his teeth, but managed to keep
silent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you speak of the young Frenchman, whose mother
is a Russian?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
Yuki&#39;s eyes fell and her chin quivered. &quot;Yes, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speak!&mdash;fully!&quot; said he, after a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He offered me marriage many times, your Highness, and
I refused, saying that not without my parents&#39; consent could
I answer. Then, at one hour, being weak, I promised. In
the foreign land, where you and my father sent me, such
promises bind,&mdash;even as the oaths of men. I have been
bound.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gods of my ancestors! Must I listen to this cat-mewing?&quot;
groaned Onda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be quiet! The girl shall speak. Yes, Yuki,&quot; he continued,
his eyes softening as they returned to her white face,
&quot;I felt that you had promised. And so, in my letter, if you
will recall, I assured you that you were not bound.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Highness!&quot; ventured the girl, at length. &quot;It was
your noble thought, your decision, not my own. I am bound.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè looked at her in mild wonder, with the faintest
touch of a smile. &quot;And not even your daimyo&#39;s word can free
your childish promise? You have courage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The mad lynx! Let me deal with her!&quot; panted Tetsujo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He, my father, so speaks and thinks of me!&quot; broke in the
girl, with passionate protest and a wide-flung gesture toward
Onda. &quot;In that country no shame is felt for such a promise.
Yet my father treats me as an outcast, a blot upon the family
name! I ask you, Lord, who are great and strong, to help
me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To what shall I help you, little one? To marriage with
an alien?&mdash;repudiation of a country that I serve?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Lord; for of myself I could not marry him, now, with
my dear land at war. When I first knew him, war had not
become even a threat. Only against&mdash;misunderstanding&mdash;and,
Lord,&mdash;being forced&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè interrupted her with his slight gesture. &quot;You will
be forced to nothing!&mdash;not now, nor so long as my voice can
use the speech of living men! Your decision is valueless
unless it be your own. It may be even harmful; for the
young branch, held down by force, slashes heaven in its
rebound. Nay, child! I would have you bend slowly to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
proffered opportunity, weighted by your own ripening desire
for loyalty and service. To compel you would be impiety.
Believe yourself protected by my word, and by my faith in
you! Be calm and think seriously, for upon this hour depends
more than you can fathom!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His deep voice boomed into a silence long maintained. One
of the tall candles sputtered and flared. Iriya rose quickly to
mend it. Tetsujo&#39;s arms, within short blue cotton sleeves,
were folded and pressed tightly down upon his chest, as if to
keep back straining utterance. Through the stillness his
quick breaths ran. The girl gazed out now, motionless, beyond
Haganè into the wet blankness of the garden. Familiar
outlines of rock and bridge and pine kept there, she knew,
their changeless postures. Only a fallen darkness hid them.
So in her heart must be immovable shapes and living growths
of heroism and selfless devotion. An Occidental training
superimposed upon a child&#39;s fresh fancy; a foreign love,
jealously guarding for its own purpose the tissues of new
thought,&mdash;these things hid the garden of her heart as night
now hid her father&#39;s garden. Haganè&#39;s look and words were
bringing dawn, a dawn perhaps of sorrow, a day dragged up
from an heroic past, and trailing its own hung clouds of
tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè spoke again. His deep voice calmed and satisfied
the unstable silence. He changed his position very slightly,
facing Yuki more squarely. He raised his massive chin, and
a smile played on a mouth that seemed made for stern sadness.
Quite irrelevantly, he began to relate to his small audience an
incident of his crowded day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember, Tetsujo,&mdash;Yuki also may recall from
her childhood&#39;s impression,&mdash;that, as one stands on the jutting
corner of my Tabata land, by the large leaning maple,&mdash;a
corner so steep that it must be upheld by the hewn trunks of
pines,&mdash;exactly at foot of the cliff stands a very small cottage,
with roof patched by the rusted sides of old foreign kerosene
cans?&quot; He paused for an answer. Yuki&#39;s eyes would not
leave the dark mystery of the night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember most clearly, your august Highness,&quot; murmured
Onda, with a respectful inclination of his head toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
the great man, but an indignant scowl in the direction of
Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An aged woman and her only child, a son, live in that
house. He is a good son, for though hot with the desire for
military service, he has kept steadily to his labor as under-gardener
on my place. There seemed to be no one else with
whom his mother could find a home. Of late the boy has
looked ill. I have overheard the servants say that his soul
was attempting to leave the chained body and go off, as it
wished, to the battlefield. Such agony as this repression, I
believe only our countrymen are capable of experiencing or of
enduring.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, at last, Yuki turned and fixed her look on Haganè.
He did not notice this any more than he had seemed to
observe her previous indifference.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The youth dutifully kept this longing from the old dame.
But she questioned, and through her slow round of domestic
services she pondered. Then she came to understand. Perhaps
the young soldier-husband, dead for thirty years, had
returned&mdash;to whisper. Whatever the cause, she came&mdash;to&mdash;understand.&quot;
He paused an instant, as if to take a firmer
hold upon his voice. &quot;To-day,&mdash;scarcely an hour ago, Yuki,&mdash;the
youth, returning from labor, found his mother&mdash;dead&mdash;before
the family shrine. She had used her husband&#39;s short
sword. It will be buried with her. The smile upon her old
face had gained already the youth and glory of a god&#39;s. She
left no message; the smile told him all.&mdash;To-morrow the son
takes passage for Manchuria.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s dawn had come. It hurt her, like the birth of a
soul. Haganè saw the same look which, for one fleet instant, he
had evoked from her at Washington. His strong heart reeled
toward the girl. Iriya was sobbing softly. Tetsujo sat square
like a box. He envied the mother and the son. He saw no
pathos in the tale, only victory. Those two would be together
on the Yalu; while he, Tetsujo, famed warrior, skilled swordsman,
must pine at home and listen to the pulings of weak
women!</p>

<p class="indent">The glory grew on Yuki. Above the flowers of the tokonoma,
above Haganè&#39;s head, hung a tattered battle-flag of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
own clan. She recognized it now. Her hands trembled.
She lifted them toward Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Onda Yuki-ko!&quot; he almost whispered, so deep and tense
his voice became. &quot;This year, this day, this very hour, may
be the pivot of human history upon this planet! And is not
the diamond-point on which that mighty turning rests, the
Spirit of Japan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Banzai Nippon! Dai Nippon! Banzai! Banzai!&quot; shouted
Tetsujo, and beat his fists on the matting.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè, with a smile that seemed to deprecate yet condone
his kerai&#39;s vehemence, went on directly to Yuki. &quot;Strange
that Western minds&mdash;the astute American politician, the
journalist, even the cleverest of Europe&#39;s statesmen&mdash;hardly
claim to look forward more than a few years,&mdash;five, ten, at
best half a century! They want results they shall live
to see&mdash;after them the deluge! As they have forgotten the
very names of their grandfathers, so they ignore their descendants.
But we of the East count time in other lengths. We
do not bound our horizon with personal aim or the catchword
of a day. We owe,&mdash;we owe ourselves,&mdash;all, to a future
that we may not comprehend, but have no right, in our ignorance,
to cramp. What we are fighting for at this moment
will not be fully realized for two hundred years. Then it
will be seen as a great landscape in a valley. Your foreigners
are like children that play now in that valley. But every
Japanese patriot stands lonely on a mountain,&mdash;very lonely,
very lonely!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is one alone in a shining company of spirits, Lord?&quot;
asked Yuki, a wonderful glow now kindling in her long eyes.
&quot;Will that youth of whom you told us be lonely, though he
stand singly against a squadron of Cossacks? Where is his
mother&#39;s soul? O Gods of my country! O my dear Christian
God! why was it not given to me to be a man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think that the soul of a woman who shirks would
be less cowardly if put into the body of a man? Even your
Christians could tell you better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord! Lord!&quot; cried the girl to him in great stress, &quot;am
I indeed of the coward&#39;s heart? Is this thing I call fidelity
but a shirking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
&quot;A Japanese has no fidelity but to his Emperor!&quot; thundered
Onda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be quiet, Tetsujo! Listen, poor wavering little heart;
I will try to make you understand. You cannot be allowed
to marry this man, not because we wish to thwart you, but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said I would not marry him, now,&mdash;not now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what will you do?&quot; asked Haganè. &quot;All are striving
to their utmost. What will be your part? Do you intend
to sit sullen and inactive here, at home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The wench shall remain no longer under my roof!&quot; raged
Tetsujo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will remain under your roof, good Tetsujo, and be
treated with courtesy,&quot; corrected the prince.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me go as a nurse! Oh, I could never stay with them!
Their harsh eyes would flay me! I feel even now their
hatred!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not mine, my baby, my only child!&quot; wailed Iriya.
&quot;Think not so of your mother&#39;s imperishable love!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki at last hid her face. The note of anguish in her
mother&#39;s voice overcame her pathetic defiance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My official residence is cold and lonely,&quot; remarked Haganè,
sipping slowly at some tea. &quot;It sorely needs a mistress well
acquainted with foreign etiquette. Foreigners are to be met
and conciliated. The Emperor himself, and his shining spouse,
would receive one who so served her land, and hear from her
own lips impressions of America, and the sentiments of the
people there toward us. A woman&#39;s intuition is keen, and
penetrates farther than a man&#39;s weightier judgment,&mdash;just as
the tendrils of a vine creep into lattices which a tree would
only darken. It is in such a capacity, Yuki-ko, that you could
do immediate good. My disorganized servants would again
be set into grooves of usefulness. Another reason, which
must not be spoken openly, as yet,&mdash;I may soon be called to
the front, and the several residences should not be closed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord! You would trust with such responsibilities a weak,
untutored girl like me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, little one, I would trust you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I would be in all respects&mdash;your&mdash;wife?&quot; asked
Yuki, in a very low tone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&quot;Yes. Why not? What is the human body but a petal
drifting in the wind? If, for a moment, the bright tint or
the fleeting perfume please, is it not best to grasp the trivial
pleasure? Yet it is to great things that I call you, Onda
Yuki. Things of service, of the spirit, heroism perhaps, perhaps
self-sacrifice,&mdash;for the flesh is stubborn. This shall be
your proof of loyalty to your Emperor and to this land!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would gladly die for them!&quot; she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè emptied the few dregs of his teacup into the hot
ashes of the hibachi, ignoring the ceremonial little bowl put
near for the purpose. &quot;It was in Washington, I believe, that
once before you made that foolish remark. What use would
death be, especially if you seek it as an escape from conditions
that do not please you? Cowardice is a crime of the spirit! I
see no chance for you to serve but this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But to be your wife, your wife&mdash;while yet he&mdash;that
other&mdash;holds my pledge!&quot; murmured the girl, piteously,
under her breath. &quot;I prayed for freedom, but he would not
send it&mdash;!&quot; Gwendolen&#39;s telegraphic words, &quot;I would accept
H.&quot; came to her like a little gust of refreshing wind. She
looked again squarely into Haganè&#39;s noble face. For the first
time Pierre&#39;s rose before her, a little weak, a little over-delicate,
with incipient lines of self-indulgence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My child,&quot; said Haganè, almost in a pleading tone, &quot;Japan
must not lose you. Put your life into my hands, and let me
wield it for our country&#39;s need. I believe my motives to be
selfless. If indeed your young beauty blurs my vision, then
will punishment rightly follow. But I take that hazard. Had
I a son, you should be, more fitly, his wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If your father&#39;s everlasting curse&mdash;&quot; Tetsujo began; but
Haganè stopped him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We need no curses, Tetsujo! You are showing yourself
unworthy of this brave child. Be quiet, I say; and let her
own soul speak to her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya gasped, and Onda bit his thick lip to the blood.
Yuki&#39;s lifted face had the pathos of dying music. &quot;Will my
soul speak, Lord?&quot; she breathed. The sound of her voice was
cold and thin, and touched with a mystic fear.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost as if gathered in to answer, from the far distance a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
muffled chorus of a thousand whispering voices quivered in
the air,&mdash;drawing nearer, nearer,&mdash;until the sound seemed to
press upon their very hearts. Now over the garden a soft,
pale light began to dawn. It grew to a concourse of a thousand
spirit-lamps, crossing, recrossing, flickering, then passing on.
Feet moving softly, though by the hundred, went by in ghostly
rhythm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord! Lord!&quot; panted Yuki, wild-eyed. &quot;What is it? Do
you hear also? or is it only I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè did not answer at once. He watched the girl&#39;s face
as one watches a changing chemical. When the sound had
grown unmistakably human, though of voices kept low and
tense with unusual awe, he said quietly, &quot;You have all
heard of the brave young Commander Hirosè, who died rescuing
his friend, in the second attempt to block Port Arthur.
This is a band of Koishikawa students passing down to the
railway station to meet him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped, wondering how much the girl could endure.
The glare of the white lanterns, borne aloft, ploughed a great
soundless trench of light through the trees and houses that
line the steep slope of Kobinata&#39;s hill. Light surged over
the thorn and bamboo hedges of Onda&#39;s home, brimming the
garden with a tender radiance, and revealing hillock, shrub,
and tree as in a faint unearthly dream. It threw a deeper
glow into the face of Haganè, and over the battle-flag above
him.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Tetsujo, he listened to the passing of countless feet
in sullen gloom. He hated the students that they were young.
He envied the death of Hirosè. It would be a clear personal
joy to die that way, and have one&#39;s name blazoned as a new
god. A nobler soul might have cared little for such posthumous
recognition; but old Onda&#39;s generosity did not reach that
height. To him, heaven was a place where spirits swaggered,
and bore the two swords of the samurai.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè, looking only at Yuki, continued softly: &quot;A hundred
thousand lanterns of the dead will be carried this night,
for the brave boy. It is but a fragment of his flesh, that was
found with a bit of uniform clinging to it; but the precious
relic will have&mdash;friends, to bear it to the temple. There his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
young widow, smiling like a statue of Kwannon, awaits it;
and his little son, calmly proud that his father has become a
great spirit. No heart in Nippon, to-night&mdash;but worships&mdash;Hirosè!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè&#39;s voice had been even enough, and calm; but something
in it loosened Yuki&#39;s soul from the flesh. Again she
stared at him, as if mesmerized. Then suddenly she half rose,
leaning toward him, and hurled herself face down on the
mats, within reach of his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All that I have to give is dust! The body is nothing!
The gods have released me! Take me, great-hearted man, and
use me to my country&#39;s need!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The shifting footsteps all had passed. The faint reflected
glamour of the lanterns spread far below along the level stone
road by the Arsenal. The garden was plunged again into blackness.
Onda stared, as if dazed, after the lights, then brought
his eyes to Yuki&#39;s prostrate body. His slow wits could not
seize, at once, the realization of so ineffable a hope. Iriya
muffled her sobs in her sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè, to reassure Yuki, had put a hand lightly upon her
thick hair. No one but the spirits&mdash;if they were near&mdash;saw
a dull red tide of passion surge up to his broad face, swelling
his neck into purple veins, and twitching at the sinews of the
powerful hands. But his voice, when he answered, was that
of a high-priest. &quot;In our Emperor&#39;s name, my child, I accept
the gift. May the gods assist me to use it worthily!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsujo, half crawling, reached the tea-tray, and drained a
stale cup to the dregs. Yuki lay so still that Iriya took fond
alarm. The joy and triumph faded from her face. She met
Haganè&#39;s look with a slight appealing gesture toward her child.
Haganè nodded. She crept to Yuki, tugging at her sleeve,
and trying to push her up from the floor. Haganè leaned
forward, and picked the girl up like a toy. She put out
a faltering hand and touched her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, come, my treasure!&quot; whispered Iriya. &quot;Let us go together
to your little room, where quiet will best restore you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, dame!&quot; said Haganè. &quot;I must speak with
Tetsujo, in your presence.&quot; The old kerai was on his knees,
bowing, his exultation only exaggerating his humility.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
From the impersonal ring of Haganè&#39;s orders, he might
have been outlining a Manchurian campaign. &quot;Let there be
no delay! Since at any hour I may be ordered to the front,
I wish the ceremony over, that I may instruct Yuki in certain
official duties before I leave. And remember, this is no time
for expenditure or display.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your will is mine, Augustness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is Friday. Next Wednesday, then, at my Tabata
villa! All shall be in readiness. Is this as you wish, Yuki-ko?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your will is mine, Lord,&quot; whispered Yuki, echoing unconsciously
her father&#39;s words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The child trembles. May I not conduct her to her
chamber?&quot; asked Iriya of the prince.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dame,&quot; replied he, kindly. &quot;And, brave little one,
farewell! I am overcharged with duties, and may not see
you again till Wednesday, at noon. One instant!&quot; The two
women paused, Iriya facing him expectantly, Yuki with head
hung low. &quot;I want to say, here, in the presence of my too-zealous
Tetsujo, that Yuki is to be treated, from this moment,
with the respect and dignity that becomes a Princess Haganè.
There is to be no espionage; no opposition; no suggestion of
restraint of any kind! My entire confidence is with my future
wife. Do you understand that, Onda Tetsujo?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; growled Tetsujo, crimson with mortification;
but he did not forget to bow.</p>

<p class="indent">In her own room Yuki stood staring, dazed, ignoring her
mother&#39;s frequent suggestion to be seated. &quot;No! Let me
breathe! Let me learn to breathe again!&quot; muttered she at
last, and caught her mother&#39;s arm as she stepped to the tiny
veranda. From the guest-room beyond, where the two men
talked, a soft light gleamed, throwing the pebbled paths of
the garden into little Milky Ways of light. The shrubs lay
round and dark, like a flock of little clouds. Beyond all
rose the tall black hedge of bamboo and of thorn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My child,&quot; said the mother, &quot;you have brought to us great
happiness and pride. Surely reward will come to you, even
in this incarnation. I will pray ceaselessly to Kwannon in
your behalf.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
Yuki leaned closer to her mother. The cool wet smell of
the garden already stole away some of the hot bewilderment
from her brain. The angry waves of indecision, girlish longing,
and patriotism, which had raged so furiously together,
now began to recede, leaving bare at last a small white strip
of thought. She was safe now, pledged, not to personal joy,
but to heroic service. The greatest of all men was to be
her teacher, her helper, her&mdash;husband! Well, what of it?
Nothing was too great a sacrifice for Nippon. And if Pierre
would only not misjudge too cruelly! Even in this first
vicarious shudder of Pierre&#39;s grief, she could not feel that he
would suffer long. His agony might at first be intense and
uncontrolled, but, through its very exaggeration, would the
more swiftly pass. For her sake, now, he must leave Japan.
This was the last boon that love should ask of him.</p>

<p class="indent">From the street, from the other side of that inky bamboo
wall, came the low notes of a foreign song,&mdash;a strain from
Carmen. The girl shivered once, and was still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what is it?&quot; cried Iriya, herself on edge, and looking
about in terror.</p>

<p class="indent">Again came the song, soft and clear. The singer stood,
evidently, just beyond the bamboos. Yuki&#39;s lips writhed
together. Her fingers tore and twitched, one hand in the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki! My Yuki!&quot; came a voice. &quot;Is it too late?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly wrenching herself from Iriya&#39;s arms, the girl sprang
down the two stone steps and plunged into the shadows of
the garden. As one fiend-driven, she sped over paths, shrubs,
rocks, and prim garden-stakes, until, at the hedge, she hurled
herself upon it, beating at it with frantic hands, and sobbing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, go! Go, beloved! Never again come here! Never
sing that song again, or&mdash;I cannot live at all! I have
promised&mdash;promised&mdash;a new pledge&mdash;stronger than the
other! It&#39;s of my free will I give myself to him! Go home
to your native land! Go! go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What sound is that? What do I hear?&quot; cried Tetsujo,
from the guest-room balcony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is our Yuki, walking in the garden,&quot; came Iriya&#39;s placid
voice. &quot;Disturb not your honorable spirit, Master! I am
with the child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
Tetsujo returned, to be met by a chiding, half-contemptuous
remark from his deity. A moment later, Iriya&#39;s ashen
face was in the kitchen. &quot;Suzumè! Maru! For the love
of Kwannon, come quickly! Miss Yuki is in a dead faint,
against the thorn hedge! Her hands are bleeding!&mdash;Make
no noise! The master and Prince Haganè must not know!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Spring</span> storms in Tokio, as in other capitals, sweep clean
a wide pathway of days for sunshine and the coming flowers.
On the morning after that great tempest which so nearly
crushed Yuki against the pond-stones of the garden, scarcely
could a shadow be found, so eager was the sun to atone for
past misdeeds of her naughty younger brother, the wind.
Small crumpled leaves began to straighten. Boughs, mud-soldered
to muddy earth, drew slowly upward. The old world
stirred like a conscious thing.</p>

<p class="indent">Pedestrians sent smiling, answering looks of brightness to
the sky, as they hurried along to daily work. All over the
great city, housewives were busy hanging out bed-clothing, and
standing the removable wadded straw mats (tatami) slanting-wise
against veranda posts, to get the full strength of the
sun.</p>

<p class="indent">In that vast, merry hive there was one soul, at least,
that neither saw the sunshine nor thrilled to the glory of a
re-created earth. Pierre Le Beau had been sitting for many
moments before an untasted breakfast, his body slouched
forward under the table, his eyes fixed vacantly on a square of
light slowly pushing its way through an opened window into
the room. Count Ronsard, already in his easy-chair, with
letters, papers, cigarettes, and an extra cup of coffee on a low
stand beside him, lifted, just before opening each fresh missive,
a look partly amused, partly irritated upon his sullen
compatriot.</p>

<p class="indent">Tsuna, the butler, cautiously approached, and substituted a
fresh cup of coffee for the forgotten cold one. Pierre caught
at the edge of the saucer. &quot;Merci, Tsuna,&quot; he said with a
smile which all his abstraction could not keep from being
sweet, &quot;but take all else away. I want nothing&mdash;or, at
least, I have eaten sufficiently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
&quot;Yes, Tsuna,&quot; supplemented the minister. &quot;Clear the
table, and admit no guests. If a &#39;chit&#39; comes, bring it in
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre would have sunk back into his lethargy, but the
count, having by this time finished his mail, deliberately set
himself to learn the secret of this new dejection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have we here, young lover?&quot; he cried gayly. &quot;Why
do you affront the fair morning with your sighs? La, la, I
know the symptoms,&mdash;the rueful mouth, set eyes, loathed
viands,&mdash;all speak the distemper of love. Come, now, unburden
thyself, mon fils. I have a leisure hour. I see in
thee need for brisk philosophy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre shook himself free with difficulty from his haunting
visions,&mdash;Tetsujo&#39;s black face and burning eyes; a windswept
hedge, bowing and straining in storm until at the next
gust of tempest it must lie flat, like the cover of a book, showing
clear her home; the white, strained, watching face; and,
later, in a stiller, denser blackness, faint chinks through
upright hedge-stems of bamboo falling from a broadly lighted
house; his own last desperate song of Carmen; the terrible
answering cry; the sound of feet on gravel; the sound of
tender hands beating on thorn; a mother&#39;s sob; and then,&mdash;devouring
silence. How had the sun such callousness that it
could shine to-day after such a blackness?</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard watched him until he turned slow, haggard, miserable
eyes. Then the count lowered his own. At this critical
point Pierre need not perceive the glimmer of pleased hope.
&quot;I am not unacquainted with sorrow,&mdash;and of this sort,
Pierre,&quot; he murmured gently. His voice might have poured
from an alabaster jar. Pierre felt the soothing, and still he
hesitated to reveal this deepest wound. In their one previous
discussion Ronsard&#39;s words had been drops of acid. The boy
shuddered anew at the remembered sting.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet he must speak to some one. This anguish could not
be borne alone. Later on, Mrs. Todd would purr platitudes
above him. He did not wish them yet. Now, in his bewilderment,
he needed the advice of a man,&mdash;a man&#39;s supplementary
thought. &quot;I should be glad to speak,&quot; he burst out impulsively,
&quot;only, dear sir, if you love me, give not that tonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
of your worldliness at full strength. I am hurt with life
almost to the point of flinging it aside!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard kept himself from shrugging. &quot;Tut, tut,&quot; he
said humorously. &quot;Had perplexed lovers the modicum of
existences attributed to that interesting animal, the cat, then
might they listen to all these small gusty impulses to suicide.
And, by the way, where is my Zulika, my soft, blue-tinted
amorette? Fast in the sun, I&#39;ll wager. Ah, Zulika, core of
my heart, come, warm me, while I hear of love!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At his words the great blue Persian who was sleeping near
the fire in a spot further cheered by the full light of the morning
sun, stirred drowsily, opened a reluctant eye, and closed it.
She moved again, with a shrug not unlike her master, gained
her feet, stretched her back upward, opened a mouth lined with
pink coral, and, with a last reluctant gaze toward the warm
spot she was quitting, approached her smiling master. He
drew her into the chair by his side, touched her whiskered
lips with a finger first dipped into sweetened coffee, shook
himself and her into smoother lines of placidity, and turning
again directly to Pierre, said, &quot;Now, my son, thy father confessor
is at peace. Speak what you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The episode of the cat did not please Le Beau. Indeed, he
loathed all cats, but this one in particular, in spite of its
beauty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Excellency,&quot; he began in an uncertain tone, &quot;I find
the thing difficult, perhaps unnecessary to impart. It has
become already beyond the power of any one in office to
advise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard showed interest. He tucked the cat farther out
of sight, and said, &quot;If you cannot tell, permit me to hazard
a guess. Already Mamselle Onda has received important
propositions?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre nodded. He rose to his feet and began a restless
walking. &quot;You are far-seeing, your Excellency,&quot; he cried
bitterly. &quot;It is marriage offered from the worn voluptuary
of your suggestion,&mdash;from Prince Sanètomo Haganè!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haganè!&quot; echoed the other in a low, tense voice. &quot;Though
I said that name, Pierre, I scarcely thought it. He is no
voluptuary&mdash;Mon Dieu!&mdash;but a cone of granite! As a parti
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
for that girl, the mere daughter of a rusty samurai, the offer
is brilliant, unprecedented! Of course the Onda family&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paused in a sustained note of interrogation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As you remark&mdash;her family!&quot; sneered the other. &quot;They
will coerce her to the point of torture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard drew his fat lids closer about the brightening eyes.
&quot;How long has this been known to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Since yesterday morning. I receive messages from my
betrothed through Miss Todd.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your betrothed is broken-hearted, of course, at the thought
of severance from you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My betrothed assures me of her <i>faith</i>,&quot; said Pierre, with a
defiant glance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, she will try it! Poor little devil!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur, do not make me repent already.&quot; Pierre was
angrily beginning, when Tsuna&#39;s voice at the door announced,
&quot;A letter for M. Le Beau.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard answered. &quot;Bring it in. Shut the door. Where
is the chit-book?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No chit-book or messenger came, your Excellency. It
was brought in person by Sir Onda Tetsujo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Does he wait?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, your Excellency. He turned very quickly. There is
no answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give it into the hands of Monsieur Le Beau and depart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brought by Onda, in person. It will throw light,&quot; murmured
Ronsard.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre was fumbling and fidgeting at the top of the long,
thin Japanese envelope. In an excess of childish impatience
he tore it with his teeth. The cat lifted its head at the noise,
but was pressed down instantly by the firm hand of its master.
It sneezed indignantly, and went to sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, after two flashing readings, burst into a harsh laugh,
threw the missive toward Ronsard, and then hurrying to a
window, leaned his forehead to the cold glass.</p>

<p class="indent">The note was in English, written on very thin Japanese
rice-paper, six inches wide and perhaps a yard in length. A
Japanese writing brush had evidently been used, for in the slow,
painful composition the writer had lingered, sometimes for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
following word or letter, and where the brush rested a small
round blot had spread. It was dated that morning. It contained
but one long sentence, built up of participial and relative
clauses, as in all Japanese construction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Mr. Pierre Le Beau</span>,&mdash;My daughter Onda Yuki-ko having last
night become by her own will no force the affianced [affianced held
three blots] wife of Prince Sanètomo Haganè Minister of War Daimyo
of Konda for great honor to her family and service to her native land
we respectfully desire you your honorable body from our neighborhood
remove entirely or trouble will become,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Onda Tetsujo</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Ronsard held it out. &quot;Daudet might have done better in
phrasing, but even he could have made the meaning no
plainer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre at the window gave a sound of derision, and was still.</p>

<p class="indent">The count sipped daintily at his coffee, and offered some
to the cat, who, mindful of recent indignity, turned her head.
Lifting the diaphanous screed, he read it once more carefully,
studying, it would seem, each separate word.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre raised one delicate hand and tapped on the window-frame
the rhythm of an air from Carmen. Still Ronsard
gave no sign.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, your Excellency, is this all you can remark?&quot; he
cried, whirling about as the strain threatened to become unbearable.
&quot;Has the father confessor nothing but the husks
of literary comparison to offer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Softly, my son. Another written communication will, in
a moment, be with you. This time it will be a chit, a legitimate
chit, in a bright new leather book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are pleased to be enigmatic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Non,&mdash;you flatter. There should be no enigmas to a
diplomat. This correspondent,&mdash;&quot; here he waved the sheet
airily,&mdash;&quot;has been at work on his creation since the time of
dawn. There are full three hours between his first ink and
his last. Miss Onda, on the contrary, writes with ease and
skill. Her letter of announcement went to Miss Todd. It
will soon come to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How, in God&#39;s name, do you think such things?&quot; cried
Pierre, in reluctant admiration.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
&quot;I seldom think them. They are obliging enough to come
to me,&quot; said Ronsard, with a deprecating gesture, and sank
back to an attitude of waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre stared on, half fascinated. There was something
sphinx-like about the man,&mdash;a gelatinous sphinx, not quite
congealed into certainty. Ronsard did not resent the stare.
He met it once or twice, smiling, with slight twinkles, or, to
be more accurate, slight blinks, of his small pale eyes. He
looked now as if he might soon purr, like the cat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; he murmured at length, with a slight upward gesture
of one hand. &quot;The servant-bell again. Your chit, Monsieur.
A hundred francs upon it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Done,&quot; said Pierre. He too listened eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">As they wait, in listening silence, the reader may as well
be initiated into the mysteries of the &quot;chit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In all foreign communities of the Far East, but particularly
in those where English influence prevails, three hybrid words
become part of the daily vocabulary. The first is &quot;tiffin,&quot;
the second &quot;amah,&quot; the third and most important, &quot;chit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Doubtless there are persons who know the origin of the
last. I do not. Literally, it means a written message sent by
a native runner. The foreign shops in the Far East abound
in chit-books, made, most of them, in Manchester. They can
be found in paper, cloth, or leather bindings. The &quot;élite&quot;
tend toward Russia leather with a crest or monogram stamped
in gold. Chit-books are to social life what check-books are
to fiscal. The letter, note, or present comes accompanied by
the inevitable &quot;chit-book.&quot; The recipient is supposed to sign
his name, and the hour, as in a telegram. This duty, in
point of fact, is very soon relegated to the head butler, or
the ingratiating &quot;amah,&quot; a laxity which has produced more
than one lawsuit and countless domestic scandals.</p>

<p class="indent">Tsuna, in due time, appeared with a large black leather
book, aggressively and odorously new, a gold spread-eagle on
the back. The envelope it accompanied was large and blue.
It bore Pierre&#39;s name in the clear handwriting of Miss Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">The count signed the book and whispered Tsuna to remain
just outside the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Before opening the new missive, Pierre threw himself into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
chair, his face turned partly away from Ronsard. The latter
picked up a rustling Paris newspaper, and over its quivering
upper edge watched the smooth cheek of Pierre, his left ear,
and the strip of pink neck showing over an immaculate collar.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of the folds of the blue letter fell a smaller one of
white. This was addressed to Gwendolen. At sight of it the
young man&#39;s heart gave a sick throb. He hid this in his coat,
until the other should have been read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;I send you this note of Yuki&#39;s in the original, because I want you
to see more in the changed handwriting than in the formal words. I
am not going to insult you by trying to say anything now, except that
I am sorry. I sympathize with your trouble more deeply than you
will, perhaps, believe. Come to me when you will. I shall say nothing
but kind things. It is a wide gulf of race and of inherited ideals
between you and Yuki. No love could hold the arch of a bridge quite
so wide. But remember her poor little aching heart! There! I am,
as usual, doing just what I vowed I wouldn&#39;t do. Oh, Pierre, I
am sorry for you,&mdash;sorry, sorry! The world doesn&#39;t seem a very
bright place, this morning, does it? I have been scolding a yama-buki
bush that insists upon opening in our garden; but the flowers just
laugh in my face. It is an unsympathetic universe! Your friend,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Gwendolen</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Pierre held Yuki&#39;s letter long before reading it. A breath
of her subtle personality must have clung to the scrap, for he
inhaled from it a new bitterness, a new anguish. With a
groan as of physical suffering he threw himself forward, put
elbows on his knees, and deliberately forced himself to read,
in rigid silence, the following note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">My dear Gwendolen</span>, who has been my only sister,&mdash;Your telegram
having arrived, and Prince Haganè having come to me in person
to speak of my duties and the opportunity he could give me at once in
this time of trouble and war, I have myself willingly consented to be
his wife. I am forced by nobody. You do not think badly of me for
this, but some other will think very badly. Oh, please to speak kind
and soothing things to that other. His grief is my aching always
sorrow. I care not at all for my own, but I care very much for his.
He will think me wicked and unfaithful to have broke so solemn
pledge, but at the time of breaking I did not seem to myself wicked.
We do not know how things sometimes have happened. But this has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
now happened to me. Ask him to forgive me. The marriage is to be
held very soon; in fact, on Wednesday of the coming week. According
to Japanese custom I must now be very secluded until that ceremony,
not even seeing my sister, which is you. I believe Prince Haganè is
to take me after to Kamakura. I do not care where he take me. Oh,
Gwendolen, love your Yuki and pray for her to be strong. Always
before I have been weak at a crisis. I must not now ever be weak.
If pity can be held toward me in Pierre&#39;s heart, beseech him to leave
Nippon. Your strangely feeling but loving,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Yuki</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He let the sheet flutter sidewise to the floor, his eyes absently
following. When it was quite still, the address being
uppermost, he leaned nearer. &quot;Miss Gwendolen Todd, American
Legation, Azabu, Tokio,&quot; he read, his lips moving as he
formed the words. &quot;Miss Gwendolen Todd,&quot; he began, directly,
reading again and again. A hand fell gently on his
shoulder. &quot;Is there to be an answer, Pierre?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will retain the enclosed letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">The count went tip-toeing to the door, and returned to
Tsuna the pretentious chit-book. Pierre was apparently fixed
in an attitude of melancholy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can these letters have told you anything worse?&quot; questioned
the gentle voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pierre, dully. &quot;It is worse. She is to be married
next Wednesday,&mdash;and with her own consent. She wishes it.
Next Wednesday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard did not answer. He was trying to look sad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wednesday, I tell you,&quot; repeated Pierre, now lifting bloodshot
eyes. &quot;Next Wednesday! Five days! This is Friday,
is it not? Yes.&quot; He stopped now to count the days on shaking
fingers. &quot;Five more days and she will be his wife. That
woman I love,&mdash;that pure flower to whom even my honorable
devotion seemed desecration! She will lie in that old man&#39;s
arms,&mdash;she will be his wife! God! <i>God!</i> Man!&quot; he screamed,
striking the table with one frantic fist, and then rising to hurl
himself in torment about the room, &quot;don&#39;t stand there screwing
into my brain with your fishy eyes! Have you ever known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
love&mdash;do you understand jealousy&mdash;have you heard of&mdash;hell?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At your age I knew all three,&quot; said Ronsard, calmly. &quot;I
went through all, and I live, I eat, I intrigue, I am happy. So
shall it be with you, madman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre threw back his head in a rude clamor, meant for
laughter. He was passing near Ronsard at the instant. The
elder man reached out and caught his wrist. &quot;Now, Pierre
Le Beau, stand still and hear what I have to say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the tone of command, rather than the physical detention,
Pierre stood still, wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is the best thing that could possibly happen to you.
Yes, be quiet. You shall listen. I&#39;ve endured sufficient childish
railing for one day! It is infinitely the best thing for you&mdash;for
your mother&mdash;for me&mdash;for France! I have a diplomatic
secret to whisper. That old man Haganè&mdash;for once in
his life a fool&mdash;may be sent at any moment to review the
campaign in Manchuria. He and his generals may be great, but
Kuropatkin is greater. Do you know what that may mean to
you? Ah, I thought so; at the hope of some personal reward
you flicker back to sanity. What are the honor and glory of
France to such effete sensualists as you? Bah,&mdash;it sickens me!
And yet, since some day you may become men, you must be
dealt with. Haganè, in his supreme self-confidence, urged on,
doubtless, by Onda, dares marry this young girl, though he
knows her to be in love with you! Will you destroy her love,
fool, by smothering it in her contempt? Haganè goes to Manchuria.
His young wife mourns,&mdash;hélas! I see her weeping
in his absence. There are secrets spoken in the nuptial
chamber,&mdash;documents left in charge of the pretty chatelaine.
Pierre, Pierre, celestial revenge hangs like ripe fruit to your
hand, let her marry Haganè,&mdash;let her love you! Do not revile
or scorn her. Wait&mdash;wait!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes, twinkling like those of a snake, crawled up Pierre&#39;s
face to his shrinking gaze. His fat hand still clutched with a
grasp that burned. Pierre tried to draw away. Again the
repulsion, the fascination in this man battled for his reason.
&quot;Wait!&quot; whispered Ronsard once again, and turned.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre felt himself released. He stood motionless. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
wrist stung as if a sea nettle had lashed it. He looked helplessly
around as though searching for something he could not
recall. His eyes fell on Yuki&#39;s letter. He staggered toward
it, snatched it from the floor, pressed it against parched lips,
and then, falling on his knees beside the chair, burst into a
passion of grief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; whispered Ronsard to the cat. &quot;Come, chérie.
We will leave poor Pierre awhile. It is more delicate, n&#39;est-ce
pas?&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was inevitable that a lady of Mrs. Todd&#39;s social and
confidential temperament should already have acquired an
inseparable friend. Mrs. Todd had a perpetual thirst for
what she called &quot;sympathetic comprehension,&quot; by which she
meant, in reality, abject flattery. Her husband sometimes
treated her deepest emotions with levity. Gwendolen often
turned to her complaints a bright indifference more irritating
than the husband&#39;s soothing smile.</p>

<p class="indent">The present incumbent was a Mrs. Stunt, resident in Tsukiji,
Tokio, wife of an American merchant who had lived in
Japan for nearly twenty years. Naturally, Mrs. Stunt knew
everything. She was a little woman, with white hair brushed
high from a smooth, pink forehead. Her face was round and
youthful. Although not an Englishwoman she exuded odors
of pink soap. Her eyes were blue, bright, and hard as glass.
Her reputation was that of a model wife and mother, a pattern
housekeeper, and an exemplary member of the church. People
hastened to speak well of her; they raised loud voices in
her praise, yet every one knew that Mrs. Stunt, when mounted
upon the perfectly kept bicycle she affected, was a wheeled
and leaking reservoir of scandal.</p>

<p class="indent">To the new-comer, or the casual observer, she appeared the
very incarnation of trustful candor, speaking of her domestic
affairs and those of her neighbors with a simplicity and directness
that startled while they convinced. Mrs. Stunt, however,
had her secrets. One of these, unshared even by the conjugal
ear of timid Mr. Stunt, was her connection,&mdash;virtually that of
foreign editor,&mdash;with a Tokio newspaper, called, of course in
Japanese terms, &quot;The Hawk&#39;s Eye.&quot; In addition to voluminous
printed sheets of hurrying ideographs this journal
dispensed each day a page of excellent English, and for weekly
supplement issued a pamphlet entirely in the borrowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
tongue. Mrs. Stunt was never seen to enter the shabby gates
of the &quot;Hawk&#39;s Eye&quot; building. She turned her face away
even in passing the place. She often denounced newspaper
women, and, more than once in the company of a friend who
tingled or wept under the lash of a personal item, joined in
indignation against the cowardly villain, and wondered aloud,
&quot;Who on earth that man could be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The very brief notice of Lord Haganè&#39;s coming marriage,
tucked away in important Japanese papers like a small spark
in a chimney, might have been altogether overlooked, for
news of war came in daily, and political excerpts from European
papers took much space. But &quot;The Hawk&#39;s Eye&quot; found
that smouldering spark, the mysterious breath of the foreign
editor blew it into new heat, piling tinder of comment high
about it, fanned it with the wind of gentle persistency, and
lo, the social world of Tokio leaped into flames!</p>

<p class="indent">Long since, the demure little lady,&mdash;having in mind spring
clothes for four lanky daughters,&mdash;had extracted from her
new intimate, saleable particulars concerning Pierre&#39;s betrothal,
Onda&#39;s persecution, and now Yuki&#39;s forced acceptance
of Prince Haganè. &quot;Nonsense, my dear,&quot; had Mrs. Stunt
retorted to this concluding bit of romanticism. &quot;Japanese
girls don&#39;t give a fig who they marry! For a catch like old
Haganè your Yuki would have thrown over a dozen spry
young Frenchmen, blue eyes and all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From the first instant of meeting Mrs. Stunt and Gwendolen
had been inimical. To herself Gwendolen had called
the little lady a &quot;bargain-counter snob.&quot; In return Mrs.
Stunt, keenly aware of the impression she had produced and
resentful of it as people usually are of truth, began assorting
items for the coming Saturday &quot;Hawk&#39;s Eye.&quot; Gwendolen&#39;s
affair with Dodge, their quarrel, his immediate transfer of
outward devotion to the shrine of Carmen Gil y Niestra, and
Gwendolen&#39;s irritability ever since the disagreement, were as
bill-boards to the mental gaze of Mrs. Stunt. Kindly injudicious
Mrs. Todd did not betray her daughter. There was no
need for it. When she wept above a &quot;Hawk&#39;s Eye&quot; paragraph
that called her idol a &quot;raw Western heiress, who
naturally cultivated her acquaintance with ploughs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
harrows,&quot; it was the part of Mrs. Stunt to comfort her. That
small lady, sitting near some more generous and less judicious
female friend, her eyes drooping tenderly over a &quot;pinafore for
Nan,&quot; or a knitted sock for &quot;Baby Tom,&quot; absorbed scandal
as a sponge absorbs warm water.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet let us be just. Too much may have been ascribed to
Mrs. Stunt. Perhaps even without her thrifty and unfriendly
zeal the marriage of so great a lord as Haganè must inevitably
have filled the papers and overflowed in irresponsible wide
tides of talk. Yet scarcely without her would Pierre&#39;s hinted
personality have been so openly involved, his parentage stated,
and his future course of action philosophized about. The
story in its parent &quot;Hawk&#39;s Eye&quot; was given with a wealth of
imaginative detail possible only to the born &quot;society reporter.&quot;
In substance it was as follows: Miss Onda had come from
America with the Todds. With their approbation she had
been openly betrothed, in Washington, to a young Frenchman
of pleasing appearance and high connections. (Here a
secret marriage, twisted about an interrogation mark, found
place.) When asked for his blessing the Japanese father,
hitherto unsuspicious of French designs, fell into a fit, out
of which three eminent physicians were required to haul
him. Yuki was forbidden to hold communication with her
lover. The next step was to adorn her in sacrificial and becoming
robes and offer her in marriage,&mdash;or anything else,&mdash;to
a certain powerful nobleman, whose third wife,&mdash;or was
it really his sixth?&mdash;had recently, by a fortuitous occurrence,
been &quot;returned.&quot; Touched by the sorrow of his
faithful knight, and influenced perhaps by the lackadaisical
beauty of the girl, the nobleman agreed to take her on trial,
even going through the form of a legal marriage, that the
aspirations of the French lover might be the more certainly
destroyed. Pierre, who read and brooded morbidly on these
things, was neither soothed nor ennobled thereby. But what
of it? Mrs. Stunt&#39;s four lanky daughters each had a new
spring dress with hats to match!</p>

<p class="indent">Japanese of the better class, brushing aside like gnats these
stinging personalities, approved openly of the father&#39;s conduct
and of Yuki&#39;s swift acquiescence. It was the only thing conceivable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
Their only blame for Yuki was that she had listened
to a foreigner without first obtaining her father&#39;s approbation,
an encouragement that might now urge him to be troublesome.
They felt indignant that the rejected one should continue to
repine for what a Japanese prince had deigned to accept. Old
samurai blood grew warm. The daughter of Onda Tetsujo
marry a Frenchman with a Russian mother! The very gods
held their Asiatic noses.</p>

<p class="indent">English and American men took, for the most part, the
Japanese view. Many Europeans, on the contrary, said openly
that they hoped Le Beau would yet &quot;get even&quot; with old
Haganè for stealing his sweetheart. With few exceptions,
indeed, all women sympathized with Pierre. Pierre was the
beau ideal of a despairing lover. His sensitive, beautiful face
took on with ease the lines of sleepless grief. His blue eyes,
at a moment&#39;s warning, could darken from melancholy to tragic
anguish. He could sigh in such a manner that his quivering
listeners, should Donne happen to be familiar, might have
quoted, &quot;When thou so sighest thou sighest not wind, thou
sighest my soul away.&quot; Pierre&#39;s sorrow was genuine enough,
but he liked witnesses to his grief. Needless to say that Mrs.
Todd and her satellite Stunt were among Pierre&#39;s most vociferous
supporters. Gwendolen fought many a battle for her
school-friend, but the bitterest were pitched under her own
roof.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, my very dear Miss Todd,&quot; expostulated the &quot;Hawk&#39;s
Eye,&quot; &quot;do you not consider at all the misery of Monsheer
Le Beau? Miss Onda is to be a princess, happy, courted, with
a position in the highest circles. Life can offer her no more.
On the other hand look at the jilted lover. I never saw a face
that expressed such patient grief. When he turns to me
those slow, beautiful blue eyes I&#39;ll declare I feel as if I&#39;d
like to kill that girl for making him suffer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pooh!&quot; said Gwendolen, rudely; &quot;and when he slowly
turns them round to me I want to open my parasol and say
&#39;Shoo!&#39; thinking it a cow. I like Pierre well enough. A good
deal better than you, I think, if the truth were known, but
he is among men what Chopin is among musicians. He enjoys
his sufferings and makes music out of them. Of course you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
wouldn&#39;t understand that.&quot; Rudely she wheeled and walked
away, Mrs. Stunt following with venomous eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen scarcely recognized herself during these days of
trial. She, the joyous one, the sun-maid, now wished to quarrel
with the whole world. Of course Dodge&#39;s defection, and the
ridiculous paragraphs appearing in &quot;The Hawk&#39;s Eye,&quot; had
nothing to do with her nervous condition. The causes were
obvious,&mdash;Yuki&#39;s hurried marriage and Pierre&#39;s mischievous
pose of despair.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the absurdities of gossip increased. Once, stung
beyond endurance, the girl threw herself into her father&#39;s
arms. &quot;Dad, how shall I endure these spreading slanders
about my friend? Is there nothing we can do,&mdash;nobody to
shoot, or challenge, or anything like that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go fire at those sparrows on the lawn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t joke. I can&#39;t stand it. Oh, father, you don&#39;t know
what awful things they whisper. They stop when I come near,
saying it is because &#39;I&#39;m not yet married.&#39; Now just think
of the pitchy subtlety of that. Why should people talk so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd held her close. &quot;My little girl,&quot; he began, &quot;wherever
lonely, sour-hearted women&mdash;or men&mdash;congregate, there
will the cancer-growth of scandal spread. They are the disseminators
of half our domestic tragedies. It is a disease like
other foul things,&mdash;cancer itself, leprosy, diphtheria,&mdash;though
not so fatal, for the thing they tackle is a man&#39;s soul and
character, immortal essences, never to be truly tarnished but
from within. As I figure it out, scandal is a good deal like
fungus. It may be planted anywhere, but it sticks and thrives
only where it finds a rotten spot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you help me, dad,&mdash;you do help me. Of course these
rumors cannot hurt the white heart of my darling,&mdash;but she
must not hear them. One question more, daddy&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd stopped her. &quot;It is mail-morning, and that means a
busy one. You&#39;ve had a sermon long enough for one day.
Come to think of it, why does Dodge get out of the way when
you appear? What have you been doing to my secretary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen gave a small gasp and vanished. Todd looked
after her. &quot;I thought that would send her flying.&quot; He
turned to his desk. His face was very tender. &quot;Poor little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
one,&quot; he murmured, &quot;she&#39;s up against her first experiences
all in a bunch. God help her! Things hurt worse when we
are young. But all will come right, with His help. I know
my child was made for happiness. She has the hall-mark of
it under her skin. But Yuki&mdash;poor little Yuki&mdash;!&quot; He
shook his head, seated himself, and soon became lost in the
voluminous foreign mail.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Yuki, pale, white, and docile, moved like a determined
ghost through vistas of gray hours. In that quiet household
came no hint of scandal, and for Yuki&#39;s part, had she heard,
she would not have greatly cared. The first brief chapter of
her life was gone, shut down, like a book, and in its pages was
the living flower of her love. She did not suffer now. She
felt a dull gladness that she was inevitably committed to
her duty. Temptation and further striving had vanished
from her days. Except for the sorrow of that dear one
there would be no regret. What anguish came personally,
through remorse for her broken faith, she would be glad to
bear. She had, through faithlessness, won the level of a
higher faith. Let her wounds gape and her heart&#39;s blood fall
like rain! She wished to feel more sorrow than she felt, but
nothing came very clearly in these days of preparation. More
than once she thought, with a tiny pang of apprehension,
&quot;If I have lost the power to feel pain, then are sacrifice and
duty alike robbed of their essential oil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, in place of averted faces and blank eyes, those of the
Onda household fawned about her. Onda made grim overtures.
The giggling of Maru San ceased only with her
slumber&mdash;that, too, was audible&mdash;while old Suzumè, darting
about the rooms like a gray ferret, babbled out the many
titles that her nursling soon would wear, and made coarse
jests and prophecies about the future.</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya alone moved in the silence of her daughter&#39;s spirit.
The two women grew very close, though no spoken word was
used to show it.</p>

<p class="indent">Wednesday, the marriage day, arrived softly. Yuki neither
dreaded nor welcomed it. She had not seen Prince Haganè
since the night he took her answer. Quite a number of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
parents&#39; relatives, some from distant provinces, came in and
gathered in the house to bid the bride farewell, to throw,
laughingly, the dried peas after her, to sweep the abandoned
dwelling to its farthest corner, and light a bonfire at the gate
when she passed through.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, in her white bridal robes and concealing veil of white
silk, thin in texture but stiffened in a way that brought it into
angular folds about her shoulders, stepped alone into a new
jinrikisha. Tetsujo and Iriya, in a double vehicle, followed.
These three alone went to Tabata, where they met a corresponding
party of the same small number, Prince Haganè, his
nearest male relative, the old Duke Shirota, and young
Princess Sada-ko, the old duke&#39;s granddaughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè was unmistakably preoccupied. His thoughts did
not attach themselves with ease to things or persons. He
had an air of relief when the short ceremony came to an
end. Yuki now changed her white robe for a dark-hued silk,
superb in texture, the gift, according to Japanese etiquette,
of her husband. A hairdresser was in readiness to change
forever the wide loops of a girl&#39;s coiffure into the more
elaborate structure of a young matron. The Princess Sada-ko
fluttered near, talking prettily and congratulating herself on
the acquisition of a new relative. Yuki scarcely heard her.
She felt almost nothing. As the last touch came, the thrusting-in
of a great tortoise-shell pin, she shuddered very slightly,
thinking of that ivory one broken with Pierre Le Beau on the
moonlit prow of a ship.</p>

<p class="indent">With a great clattering and stamping the Haganè coach of
ceremony drew up to the entrance-door. Magnificent gray
horses in new trappings snorted impatience to be off. Haganè
stepped in without a word to Yuki, who, at a nudge from the
little princess, meekly followed. The domestic retinue fell on
its knees in the doorway and along the pebbled drive. Haganè
gave the order, &quot;Shimbashi,&quot; waved a hand abstractedly, and
the equipage dashed away.</p>

<p class="indent">The short railway journey was made practically in silence.
Haganè said once, as if by way of explanation, &quot;Important
and somewhat alarming news has come by secret wire to-day.
It is necessary for me to ponder over it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
&quot;Honorably do not concern your august mind with a person
so insignificant,&quot; said Yuki. Far from resenting his silence,
the girl was thankful to be left to herself. She watched the
scenes outside with eyes at first vague and unintelligent, but
which soon gained a soft, increasing brightness. Earth was
waking from its long sleep. Yuki felt what many of her own
and other races have in such crises felt,&mdash;a gratitude to nature
that human grief is given no part in it. The grass still is
busy, small waxen blossoms lift the leaves of a fallen year, no
matter what men may suffer. In moments of keen personal
bereavement, when the soul is dazed and blinded by the wonder
of its agony, a certain resentment comes. Like the Ayrshire
poet we cry, &quot;How can ye be so fresh and fair?&quot; But
such grief was not yet Yuki&#39;s. Her emotion still partook more
of bewilderment than loss. Pierre was not dead. He might
yet be happy, happier than with her. This thought brought
no personal sting. Hers was not a nature for jealousy.</p>

<p class="indent">Because of her marriage, through this stern, grave man who
sat beside her, she was to be given her opportunity for loyal
service. Mistrust of self, apprehensions that mocked and
taunted her, a certain shrinking from responsibilities so
thickly heaped, rushed inevitably to her mind. On the other
hand she had for guidance his great spirit of untarnished
patriotism; she had vindicated to her parents all filial obligation,
and springtime peeped at her from among the hills.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw that a thousand nameless, beloved little flowers
traced with bright enamelling the leaden dykes of fields.
Seedling rice brimmed with gold-green, small, separate pools.
Straw-shod farmers trampled, one by one, the rotting stubs of
last year&#39;s crop into the slime of fields to be new-planted. On
low-thatched huts the old leaves of the roof-lilies fed a springing
growth. Everywhere decay passed visibly into re-birth.
So, thought little Yuki, &quot;The very sorrow I have endured shall
feed my new resolves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the small Kamakura station jinrikishas were awaiting
them, accompanied by two persons, an old man and a comely
woman of the peasant class, whom Yuki rightly took for family
servants. They prostrated themselves upon the cement
floor in an excess of demonstration, whispering old-fashioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
phrases of congratulation and of welcome. Haganè came back
for an instant to things around him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These are my faithful servants, Bunshichi and his daughter.
I do not now recall her name,&quot; said he to Yuki, with his kind
smile. &quot;They form our entire domestic retinue at Kamakura,
for it is here that I come only when in need of true repose and
relaxation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai! hai! Danna-San,&quot; cried the servants in polite corroboration,
and began a new series of deep bows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai!&quot; murmured Yuki, as if in echo of their subservience.
The woman, for an instant, met her young mistress&#39;s eyes.
There was something in the look of wonder, of great kindness,
and then,&mdash;or so it seemed to Yuki,&mdash;of compassion.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè entered his kuruma and started off. Yuki and the
two servants followed. And so, on this fair March day, the
little Princess Haganè approached the first of her many new
homes.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Haganè villa at Kamakura possessed its own green
niche cut deep into encroaching hills, its own curved scimitar
of gray sea-beach, its individual rocks, its blue ocean, and
bluer sky. A fence of dead bamboo branches, set up on end
like fagots, barred out spying curiosity. The house faced
directly to the sand. On the three remaining sides the hill-slopes
made retreating walls. Upon them grew spindling,
wind-tossed pines and loops of wild white clematis and of
rose.</p>

<p class="indent">Through the big, fragrant rooms of the villa all day the sea-winds
passed, stirring the few kakemono, and making flowers
in bronze vases nod like those more securely rooted on the
hills. No attempt had been made at an ornamental garden,
except for a few great, gray stones spread with a lichen
sparkling from its diet of salty dew, three curious small
pines, and spaces of white sand. The placing of these trees
and stones hinted of more organic beauty than all the convolutions
of the average Occidental millionnaire&#39;s park. It is
only fair to add that the millionnaire would not agree to this.</p>

<p class="indent">The first two hours after arrival were devoted by Prince
Haganè to the writing of telegrams and letters. These were
sent off by messengers as soon as finished. The statesman
strode out alone to the shore and walked there, his head
bent in meditation, until telegraphic answers began to arrive.
These apparently bore reassuring news. He sought out Yuki,
his sleeves quite stiff with crumpled missives, and told her
that already he had arranged his affairs so that he could have
two days to belong to himself alone. &quot;Unless some unforeseen
matter of gravest importance should transpire,&quot; he
added, &quot;I shall not be disturbed. I shall give orders to Bunshichi
to bring me no letters that do not bear the Imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
seal. And now, my child,&quot; here he seated himself near her,
&quot;I may be permitted to recall the fact that I have a wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For two days Yuki was seldom out of his sight. The shrinking,
delicate, humble, exquisite thing, now so entirely his own,
fed his stern eyes and heart with ever-deepening satisfaction.
Her pallor, her reticence, even the strained smile which she
sometimes turned to meet his words, were all as best he liked
to have them. An arrogant, self-assertive bride is, to the
Japanese, an inhuman monster.</p>

<p class="indent">On the third morning Bunshichi brought him with his
breakfast the accumulated mail of the two days. At sight
of the great heap he sent a quizzical glance to Yuki. &quot;It
appears, small sweet one,&quot; he remarked, &quot;that I am to have
no more hours of happy indolence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before the first ten were read Yuki knew herself forgotten.
Her bruised soul stirred within her like a wounded thing
recalled to animation. She started violently at his next loud
words. &quot;I take the earliest train to Tokio. Have my kuruma
waiting.&quot; His voice was that of a master, not a lover.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki rose swiftly. At the kitchen-step she paused, threw
back her head, and took in a few long, long breaths. The servants
below waited, open-mouthed, for her orders. Meta&#39;s
kind voice recalled her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you wish, August Mistress?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, Meta&mdash;I was thinking&mdash;I forgot. The master
takes the next train to Tokio. When does that train start?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meta&#39;s eye consulted the Waterbury clock. &quot;In twenty
minutes, Mistress. Perhaps the Illustrious One will not wish
to hasten so swiftly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, he desires to go at once. Go quickly, Bunshichi,
call a kuruma with two runners. Our master is a
heavy man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her commission filled, Yuki returned slowly to the room
where her husband still sat reading letters. On the way a
thought smote her. &quot;Your Highness, the train in twenty
minutes honorably departs. Your kuruma will be in readiness.
Was it your august intention that I should accompany
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè looked up at her in a sort of half-recognition.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
&quot;You? Accompany? No, of course not. I would not have
the time to give you. In a few days more, perhaps. Put
those scattered letters and papers into a leathern portfolio.
Bunshichi will know what else I need. How fortunate that
a train goes so soon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Between this and the starting moment he had for her neither
look nor word. Just as he stepped, however, into the vehicle,
he turned as with sudden, loving remembrance, and leaning
far down to her said, &quot;These days have been as the heavenly
island of Horai set in a sea of raging politics. You are a
docile and obedient wife. So shall I inform your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he had really gone, and even the heavy clink of jinrikisha
wheels on sand was no longer audible, Yuki lifted her
head, brushed back the low fall of hair from her forehead, stared
at the quiet sea for a moment, and then turned and walked back
slowly into the house. For a few moments she wavered, pausing
now, now walking swiftly, now looking about as for something
she had lost. In such broken, indeterminate angles of
advance she reached a little chamber quite remote from the
rest, a closet darkened by nearness of a rising cliff. Here she
stopped short. A physical shudder ran through the length of
her. She moaned, bit her lips back into silence, pressed suddenly
white hands upon her vacant eyes, and then, failing all
at once, fell to the matting, and lay, face down, along its pallid
surface. At last&mdash;at last&mdash;for a few hours at least this
tortured smile, this self-inflicted strain could be shaken off
and she, like a driven beast of burden, could lie still, to die, to
moan, or slowly to gather back what remained of endurance.
Her thoughts buzzed confusedly like a great swarm of bees
whose nest has been taken.</p>

<p class="indent">Through the sweet spring day she lay prone, inanimate,
stirring only at a passing sting of consciousness. &quot;My country&mdash;my
Emperor!&quot; once she moaned aloud. &quot;O Kwannon
the Merciful! O my Christian God!&mdash;must I live, can I
endure it? Already I am cowed and broken. Shall I ever
again look a flower in the face?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">More than once the kind-hearted maid-servant knelt beside
her, urging food and drink, or a walk into the reviving air.
Yuki seemed not to hear. After one such unsuccessful excursion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
Meta returned to the kitchen, shaking her head. &quot;They
have married that beautiful young maiden to our august yet
somewhat ancient master, and her heart&#39;s love dies within her
for another. Oh, I know well enough!&quot; she cried, with a touch
of defiance, as her father lifted bleared, protesting eyes; &quot;so
was I bartered to the wicked man who beat me and drove
me forth. I may be of low estate, but I know a woman&#39;s
heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you know the seat of folly,&quot; grumbled the old man.
&quot;When your husband drove you out, I suppose he had reason;
I received you, didn&#39;t I?&mdash;I allow you still to call me
father&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and do all your work and mine too for it,&quot; muttered
the woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As for our young mistress,&quot; went on the old man, ignoring
this last impertinence, &quot;all know her for the most fortunate
young woman in this empire and, therefore, in the world. Is
she not lawfully married to the richest and most powerful of
lords, to Prince Haganè?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meta seated herself on a low bench and began to clean the
fish for dinner. &quot;Yes, father,&quot; she answered at length, &quot;and
this newly snared fish whose honorable insides I am preparing
to remove is to be eaten by that same rich and powerful lord.
Does that make the knife in its belly less sharp?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The round sun was bisected by a western hill-top pine when
Meta knelt again beside her mistress. &quot;August Lady, you
<i>must</i> listen. A telegram has arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki sat up instantly. She had begun to tremble. Her
hair, now disordered, fell about an ashen face. &quot;Has my
master come?&quot; she cried, a wild look flashing into her eyes,
but lapsing almost immediately into dulness. She put up
both hands and spread wide the night-black wings of her hair.
Meta drew down one little hand and thrust the telegram between
its fingers. &quot;Oh, a telegram,&quot; said Yuki, embarrassed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you not mention&mdash;perhaps Lord Haganè will
not come back to-night.&quot; She read the few words carefully.
Again that faint, sickening throb of relief passed over her.
She lifted her head and met the woman&#39;s eyes as she said,
trying to seem calm and unconcerned, &quot;It is true,&mdash;our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
master cannot come to-night. He bids me remain until further
message.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meta bowed. &quot;Condescend to receive my condolence, noble
Mistress. You will be honorably lonely, I fear. But such is
always the fate of one married to a great statesman like our
lord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Yuki, eagerly, &quot;and, Meta, I wish last of all
things to become an obstacle in his illustrious path.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mistress,&quot; said the servant, in her honest way, with a
smile like sunshine dawning upon the broad, fresh-colored
face, &quot;all day you have eaten nothing. May I not prepare a
little meal to tempt your appetite?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are kind to me, Meta,&quot; said the young wife. She
put a hand out to the servant&#39;s arm. For some reason known
only to women, the eyes of both flooded with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Yuki, her own smile dawning, &quot;prepare me the
little dinner. I will try very hard to eat. Indeed I think
even now I am becoming quite ravenous!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meta, laughing outright, hurried back to the kitchen. She
was a good cook, and she knew it. In this same villa-kitchen
she had served marvellous dishes to prime ministers and
princes, but never before had she worked with a heart so full
of love and tender compassion. Never was a meal more daintily
served. Slices of tai from the salt waves, embellished with
grated daikon and small foreign radishes; lily-bulbs dug from
the hills around them and boiled with sugar and wine into
balls of crumbling sweetness; lotos roots from the temple pond,
sliced thin and served with vinegar, ginger-root and shoyu,
salad of yellow chrysanthemums, pickles of coleus, cucumber
and egg-plant, the whitest of rice, and tea picked but the week
before by the dew-wet hands of little maids at Uji. Yuki was
literally betrayed into enjoyment. As she ate, Meta and the
old man peeped in at her through the shoji, nudging each
other joyously at each new mouthful.</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the evening, when lamps were lighted, and the
shoji all drawn close, the two servants, with that delicate
familiarity, that respectful presumption of which they have
made an art, found pretext to enter. At first there was but
the usual salutation, and the expressions of gratitude that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
had condescended to partake of such badly prepared food.
One question led to another. In a few moments the three
were chatting and laughing like schoolgirls, the old man
bearing, in his double superiorities of age and sex, the greater
share of the conversation. Yuki soon found that he had a
single theme,&mdash;the perfections of Prince Haganè. More from
kindness of heart than interest, she encouraged him in these
reminiscences; but in a very short time she was listening as
Desdemona to her Moor. The tales indeed were marvellous.
Once, at the age of six, or so said Bunshichi, the little Sanètomo
had gone at night alone to a distant graveyard to bring home,
as proof of his courage, the severed head of a criminal that
day executed. At eight he had slain with his own hand a
monstrous mountain-cat, terror of a cringing village. But the
story which most impressed the listener was that of a poor
leper, a beggar already eaten away beyond hope of relief, who,
having asked alms by the roadway, was questioned, the young
prince fixing thoughtful eyes upon him, &quot;You ask for money
to buy food, is that the best gift I could offer you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, Master,&quot; answered the thing who once was man,
&quot;there is a better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Name it,&quot; said Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Death,&quot; sobbed the beggar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So think I,&quot; cried the boy, and, without further speech,
sent his short sword to the leper&#39;s heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Meta always shuddered at this tale; but Yuki raised her
head with so still and white a look that the old man felt uneasy,
and began to explain at length. &quot;It was really the best
gift, Mistress, and after it our princeling had him buried, and
many, many prayers said for the rest of his soul. He even
caused search to be made for his family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think I wish excuse for it?&quot; said Yuki, with her
strange smile. &quot;I know not which most I envy, the beggar
or Prince Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next day, fair and sweet and practically windless, except
in gusts of &quot;pine-wind&quot; from the shore, deepened the
balm of her preceding hours. Wild pinks sprang up like a
fairy people on the hills. Crows perched and chattered in the
garden pines. Little red crabs came out, and all day long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
drew marvellous maps upon the sand; and the swinging censers
of hillside roses burned a little timid incense to the sun.
All the forenoon Yuki busied herself about the house. A
long letter was written to Iriya filled with descriptions of the
day. Frequent excursions to the kitchen kept Meta and old
Bunshichi in a condition of expectant smiles. In the afternoon
a sudden thought came, bearing to the girl&#39;s mind a
hint of wonder at her own insensibility. &quot;Why, the Great
Buddha is here, not a mile away from me, and not once have
I remembered. I will go to him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meta heard the stirring, and peeped. &quot;Our mistress goes
for a walk,&quot; she told her father. &quot;Even now she lifts her
adzuma-coat. I will get her geta (clogs). Nothing could be
better for her than a walk. It is the good food that gives her
strength.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These young things beat their wings like the cliff-birds
when the cage first snaps, but soon they come to reason and
docility,&quot; chuckled the old man over his pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go to the Great Buddha, Meta San,&quot; said Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you not take an umbrella&mdash;not even a foreign bat-umbrella&mdash;to
protect your illustrious head?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On these short days the sun sinks very early. See, already
he becomes entangled, like a boy&#39;s red kite, in the branches of
those tall hill pines. I need no covering.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Should the august master deign to arrive before your
divine reappearance&mdash;&quot; suggested Meta, with deference and
a deep bow.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s face changed utterly. &quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;did not think of
him,&quot; she stammered. &quot;I will not be long absent, and, Meta,
should he come, send quickly a runner and a kuruma for me.
Do you think he will be angry, Meta, that I went?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, little Mistress, he would wish it. There is no
kinder man alive than Prince Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose he must be very kind,&quot; murmured Yuki, and
went with downcast looks into the street. The sense of
childish anticipation, of vivid expectancy were gone. Meta, in
her effort to be dutiful, had clamped more tightly the manacles
her mistress had just begun to endure. Why should she wish
to go? What matter that the Buddha waited? It was not for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
her; she could but drag before it Haganè&#39;s obedient wife, a
cowed white ghost of duty. She moved forward mechanically.
Her head sank still further forward, as if the great black
orchid of her hair grew heavier. At every step the lacquered
bars of her high clogs went deep into sand, so that it was increasingly
hard to walk. A group of children, passing, looked
up into the pretty lady&#39;s face for a smile, then hurried by in a
small panic of fear. It is a strange woman who does not smile
at children in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">Now she crossed at right angles the one street of the village,
a rough and stony thoroughfare lined with opened booths. The
street terminates abruptly at the foot of a hill whereon stands
an ancient and famous temple of Kwannon the Merciful.
Within a hundred yards of this hill an abrupt turn to the
right leads into a country of unfenced fields of egg-plant,
peanuts, and sweet potatoes; then comes another bit of hard
paved road, and then the towering Red Gate of the temple
grounds of Buddha.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki had noted dully that in little gardens the cherry trees,
always earlier here than in Tokio, were fashioning their
annual robes of pink. The wind from the sea, now rising,
threw petals out into the air before her. She watched the
fluttering signals eagerly, but for some morbid reason would
not lift her eyes to the tree. She had but one thought now,&mdash;a
hunger for the Buddha&#39;s face. She longed to test herself, to
find whether, in the gap between the Christian Yuki and
the Princess Haganè, a shred of herself still clung. This
shred, it must be, that the Buddha would smile upon.</p>

<p class="indent">Through the gate she stumbled, her gaze still on the ground.
The wide stone pathway stretched soft and pink with fallen
bloom. A breeze, entering with her, swept the surface in a
mass, as though some one twitched the far end of a long pink
rug. Petals filled the air. They came now in a small hurricane,
fretting her cheeks with ghostly fingers, burrowing softly
in her collar, catching and clinging to the long folds of her
robe. A sob stretched in her throat and hurt her. She would
not raise her eyes. She reached the two long granite steps
leading up to the inner court of the Buddha. Here petals
were banked in rosy drifts. She could see the bases of stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
lanterns standing before the shrine. An invisible hand seemed
pressing on her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Namu Amida Butsu, Namu Amida Butsu!&quot; sobbed her
lost childhood through her trembling lips.</p>

<p class="indent">An old priest, old beyond the telling, with a face as of
wrinkled silver, glided out from among the flower-laden trees.
&quot;You are in great grief, my child?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, reverend sir, in great grief; and it is of that kind
which, to a stronger heart, might not be called a grief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know; that is a kind hard to endure, but its triumph
gives greatest enlightenment. Look to the face of Buddha,
and pray for his endurance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pitying sir,&quot; sobbed the girl, &quot;I have become, while in
the foreign land, a Christian.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The smile on the old priest&#39;s face did not alter. &quot;All new
religions are but forms of the old. Buddha will not pity thee
less that thou dost call him &#39;Ye-sus,&#39; for He, too, was a
Buddha, even as you and I, daughter, even you and I, through
long striving, may become.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will dare, then, raise my eyes to him,&quot; answered the
girl. The old man stood very close to her, and as he saw the
white face lift, joined his hands and whispered, &quot;Namu
Amida Butsu!&quot; A moment later he was gone. Petals eddied
and settled where he had stood.</p>

<p class="indent">At first the young wife felt little emotion of any sort. She
gazed steadily into the marvellous, calm face with a glint of
gold under the half-closed lids and in the jewel on the forehead.
As she looked, it grew to be a thing not smoothed and fashioned
by human hands, but by the eyes and hearts of worshippers,&mdash;the
apotheosis, the embodiment of a majestic faith, so subtly
wrought of faith that should belief be changed, it, too, would
vanish like a mist, its vibrant particles loosen and dissipate,
to recombine in some new symbol. How still it was and
calm and self-assured! Its lines were growing rigid like the
formula of its creed; but in that changeless, ever-changing,
pitying smile, a deathless truth still trembled. Near it the
hills seemed little piles of dust; pines, centuries old, mere
fern-leaves of a summer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me calm, give me endurance, for they are yours to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
give!&quot; said the girl, aloud. &quot;I am less than the insects which
crawl unnoticed in the grass,&mdash;I am a blown petal, frail as these
I crush. If my life can serve this land, or aid, in infinitesimal
good, my Emperor, why can I not be glad and desire no more?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sun had fallen far below the hills. A crimson light,
a more ethereal tide, flowed across the sea, and soaked up
into the fibres of blue horizon mist. A cricket with the chill
of winter in his little voice woke into querulous chiding.
Yuki shivered and rose to her feet, drawing the robe more
tightly. She sent a glance about the wide gardens, and saw
that, apparently, she was alone. She turned as if to go, but
an overpowering instinct made her lift her face again to the
brooding face above her. How colossal, how patient, those
dark shoulders bent in the deepening twilight! Around the
lotos pedestal, the cherry trees, touched now by dull crimson
light, changed to great billows of a smouldering sea. Crows
darted through them like strange black fish, then flew off, cawing,
to homes in the pines. Again Yuki turned to go, when a
voice that froze her to the stone said softly, &quot;Ah, Madame
Haganè, what felicity to meet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre had sprung from some unknown shadow. He must
have been watching her and listening to her words. He
paused now, debonair, handsome, though a little pale, directly
beneath an outcurving granite petal of the Buddha&#39;s throne.
As she still stared, speechless, he struck a match against the
bronze and lighted a cigarette. She could not see, for her
own trembling, how his poor hands shook. The red match
glare revealed his face as distorted, evil, sinister.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he remarked once more, &quot;have you nothing to
say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time she tried to speak, but no sound came. Her
power of motion, too, was in abeyance. He moved three
deliberate steps nearer. As though the air were glass, and she
repelled by its material force, she went backward the answering
distance. Her left hand, clutching behind her, found
something hard and cold, and fastened to it eagerly. It was
the fin of a bronze dragon in full relief, twining upward, about
the trunk of a tall lantern. &quot;Yes, go,&quot; she whispered.
&quot;Do not speak more words. Go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
Pierre took another stride. She cowered back bodily into
the writhing folds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the love of God!&quot; she panted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What if one has ceased to love God?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In mercy then&mdash;in pity&mdash;in human pity&mdash;go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre laughed. &quot;<i>You</i> enjoin pity, Madame Haganè?
How quaint!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am more deeply hurted now than you; but never more
must I be weak. I am a wife. I shall serve my native
country!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does treachery and faithlessness ever serve? You delude
yourself. If Haganè is to be your strength, you will
fail,&mdash;for either Haganè or I must die. I live now only to
revenge myself upon him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The emptiness of the boast, the impotence of the suffering
boy to wreak the harm he wished, did not then come
to her. The words rang sombre and terrible. &quot;No&mdash;no,
Pierre,&quot; she cried, &quot;not that! Our Emperor needs him&mdash;our
country needs. Revenge on me, Pierre! I only was faithless.
I deserve all harm you will give.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you were faithless, but it came because of weakness,
and the low status of your sex in this barbaric land. Haganè
and your father forced you. They threatened, cowed you&mdash;tortured
you, for all I know. Look at your hands! Mon
Dieu, your little hands!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She held them forth to him with a gesture that might have
disarmed Beelzebub. &quot;I tore them myself upon that hedge the
night you came,&mdash;the night I had promised Prince Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre glared at her an instant longer. Oh, he had meant
to be so harsh! Nothing was to have softened his just wrath.
Through sleepless nights he had scourged himself with
memory until his soul was flayed. Yuki should not appeal
to him or move him. He would get from her own lips some
faltering explanation of her perfidy. Yet now, for all his
armor of resolve, two little torn hands held out silently
through deepening gloom pulled at his heart,&mdash;drew down
the visor from his quivering face.</p>

<p class="indent">Above them bent, like a great cloud, the head and stooping
shoulders of the Buddha.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
&quot;Yuki, Yuki, you have ruined my life! You have
killed my soul! I cannot consent to live unless to revenge
myself upon the man who has brought us both this agony!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pierre, if you say such thing, I must&mdash;because I am now
Japanese wife&mdash;warn my master of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This new affront to vanity stung Pierre back into some of
his assumed relentlessness. &quot;You would defend him,&mdash;betray
me already? Count Ronsard said it would be so, but I
would not listen. Why should you be true to him when you
were false as hell to me? I&#39;ll kill him, I tell you, and if I
cannot kill him in open fight, I will find some way to harm
him! I&#39;ll have you yet, Madame la Princesse. I do not give
you up, even at your own words. You owe me something!
Come, come, you owe me reparation,&mdash;help me trick him,
Yuki. You love me,&mdash;ah, I know it! This is my first
triumph, that your heart cannot forget. Yes, yes, poor
shivering slave, it is Pierre you love. Now, come, deny it!
When his arms are around you, do you not think of mine?
When his thick lips press you, do you not faint for me?
Ah, I have touched you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go&mdash;I say to you again, go, and go quickly! You with your
own speech cauterize my wound. You are a coward! Your
words are vipers which give their deepest venom first to you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In speaking the girl had drawn herself very erect. Her
face, through the twilight, gleamed luminous with inner
fire. Over her left shoulder the open mouth of the dragon
yawned. Pierre could not meet her look. He cowered back,
and pressed his eyes with one trembling hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki, Yuki, indeed I scarcely know what I am saying.
This misery bewilders me. I cannot eat or sleep. My
thoughts surge in my brain like fire in a battened ship. And
this is worst of all, that now, so soon, you are tamed,&mdash;half
reconciled! You have not loved me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I love or not love, I must not now remember. Pierre,
pity me a little. Go from Nippon; help me to be the good
woman, and the loyal one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But to this appeal Pierre could not reach. &quot;I do not give
you up,&quot; he muttered sullenly. &quot;And I will harm Haganè
when and how I can!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
Yuki stepped forward a little, still keeping one hand on
the dragon. &quot;Then stand aside, Monsieur Le Beau. I must
return.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre did not move. &quot;You shall not go,&quot; he said in the same
sullen fashion. Yuki cast a despairing glance over toward the
small house where the old priest lived, then down the long
stone walk, now white with petals. No one was in sight. She
gave a heavy sigh. On the instant the sound of Japanese
clogs came, mounting, apparently, the stone steps of the great
red gate. A form of a man in Japanese robes, unusually tall
for his race, slow and majestic in approach, now became
visible.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haganè!&quot; she said, with a great repressed cry, and bit
her lips to keep from sobbing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Diable!&quot; echoed Pierre. He gave a single look, a curse,
and pitching his cigarette on the stone flag near her, vanished
into the shadows of the lotos throne. Yuki, half-fainting
now, hung in the coils of the dragon. As though life itself
depended on his coming, she watched her husband&#39;s calm
advance. His stride was slow, splendid, and imposing, each
step eloquent of centuries of rulership. On catching sight of
her she felt that he smiled. He moved no faster. &quot;My
Lord,&quot; she murmured, not knowing that she had said it.</p>

<p class="indent">The cigarette blinked as with a single malevolent eye, and
sent up an acrid smoke between them. He stepped over it,
apparently unobservant, and held out a hand. Yuki clutched
at it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, small sweet one, how white your face gleams through
the darkness! And you lie, like a crystal ball of fate, in the
old dragon&#39;s claws! Well, here is a larger dragon come to bear
you home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki tottered toward him. At first touch of his hand had
come the sense of renewed power. &quot;I dreamed not, Lord,
that your august returning might be so soon, or I should not
have left your house. I left with Meta the message&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She gave it carefully, but I preferred to come in person
for thee, little one. Here, lean on me. You tremble. Perhaps
the walk has been too long. To-morrow we are to leave
this quiet place, and you will be Madame Haganè, wife of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
Minister of War,&mdash;Madame Haganè, official mistress of a
huge and unattractive residence. But you will brighten it,
and your friends of the American Legation shall aid you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall try with all my soul and strength, Lord, to be
worthy of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not fear, my child. All things are not to be at once
expected of a single small flake of maidenhood and snow.
How yet you tremble! Here, I will draw your arm in mine.
Cling to me. Never mind if the children on the road laugh at
us and say that the old prince is mad with love of his young
wife. In the great city I must often forget you. But wait
one instant&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had been standing, half-turned from the great Buddha.
Now he faced it, Yuki falling back a little. He raised both
hands, rubbed them softly together in invocation, and Yuki,
marvelling at him, heard the reverent words, &quot;Namu Amida
Butsu! Namu Amida Butsu!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">So,</span> without further preparation or experience, was the little
Lady Yuki, fresh from her American school, not yet completely
readapted to her native environment, installed as mistress
of a great, official mansion.</p>

<p class="indent">The servants, of course, were strangers. A few of these
bore to Prince Haganè the relation of &quot;hangers-on,&quot; impoverished
families of soldiers and retainers left from feudal days.
Others had official connection with the place, and remained
unmolested through various administrations.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first twenty-four hours the young wife moved in an
atmosphere of dazed unreality. Her first conscious interest
was in the mail. She began to watch for letters from her
mother, or Gwendolen,&mdash;perhaps from that one whom she
must forget. The thought of their last interview remained
with her as the cruelest of all her wounds. No letter came.
Pierre would not, in any case, have written, believing that
Haganè had given orders to have all letters pass first under
his inspection. The silence of Iriya and Gwendolen had
another cause. Her new and exalted rank necessitated from
Yuki the initial step. She did not know this, and Haganè,
plunged deep already into affairs of state, had not thought to
tell her.</p>

<p class="indent">She lived now almost an isolated existence. Only the head
butler dared personally address her. Even he, in requesting
orders from &quot;her Highness,&quot; bowed and smiled with a sort
of deprecating commiseration, as though he recognized her
bewilderment. Of her husband she saw little. The longing
for her mother and her friend grew poignant. Through the
great high-ceiled rooms she wandered. The face of the great
dark Buddha often loomed above her. From every shadow
she shrank, fearing that Pierre Le Beau might be in hiding.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
Three miserable days dragged by. On the fourth, Haganè
was present at the breakfast-table. News of a great victory
had come. The Western world was just beginning to realize
the true mettle in the Japanese soul. Haganè read aloud several
editorials from English and American papers, and made
comment upon them, as though his listener were a man, and
his equal. He had ordered a foreign meal, and the coffee and
excellent food stimulated the girl. Her husband&#39;s companionship
and condescension exhilarated her. It was part of a
brightening future that, even before their meal was over,
the butler should announce, &quot;Madame Onda, mother to her
Highness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki gave a small cry of pleasure. Haganè lowered his
paper, and paused to smile upon his young wife. He did not
give a hint that it was through his direct agency that the visitor
had come. &quot;Ah, your eyes brighten at this news more
even than at victory!&quot; he laughed. To the servant he said
briefly, &quot;Conduct Madame Onda to us here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The servant hesitated, &quot;Your Highness, there is with her
also an old attendant, a dame called Suzumè, who&mdash;talks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we bid the chatterer enter, Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If your Highness permit,&quot; laughed Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Admit both,&quot; said Haganè, and returned to his editorials.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki rose to welcome her guests. As the door was flung
back Iriya hesitated for a moment on the threshold. Without
a glance toward Yuki she hurried to the Prince, and, prostrating
herself, bowed again and again, with audible, indrawn
breaths. Suzumè, at her heels, followed suit, excelling her
mistress in the rapidity of repeated bows, and the power of
audible suction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, little mother of my Yuki,&quot; said Haganè, reaching
down a hand, &quot;rise now, I pray. Such extreme of deference
is not seemly in the mother of a princess. Kindly be at ease
in greeting your daughter, and converse as freely as if I were
not present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya allowed herself to be persuaded to perch on the very
rim of a leather chair and sip at a cup of coffee, while she
and Yuki exchanged compliments and inquiries as to the
health of the members of their respective families. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
always the first social duty in Japan. It takes the place of
&quot;weather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No notice whatever was being taken of old Suzumè, who
had continued genuflections and inspiration to the point of
vertigo, when Yuki at last came to her assistance. Nothing
would induce the old dame to sit on a foreign chair. &quot;She
had tried them once,&quot; she protested. &quot;They felt like a pile
of dead fish on a kitchen bench.&quot; Her post, self-assigned,
was the extreme corner of the red and green Axminster carpet.
While her superiors conversed, she let her keen, sunken eyes
dart like dragon-flies from one piece of furniture to the other,
from ceiling to floor, from curtain to framed oil-painting,
until the very texture of these things must have been photographed
on her busy retina.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few pleasant if perfunctory questions and replies,
Prince Haganè rose, saying that he had work in his private
office, and afterward must leave the house. &quot;I hope you
will remain with Yuki just as long as your domestic duties
permit,&quot; he had said last of all. Immediately upon his closing
of the door, Iriya began congratulating her daughter upon
her splendid fortune, and retailing congratulatory messages
from relatives and old friends. The little lady&#39;s feet, as she
sat on the high dining-room chair, did not quite reach to the
floor. The draught on her bare ankles just above the tabi
(digitated socks) sawed like ice. With a little gesture of entreaty
to Yuki, she hurried over to a comfortable sofa, where
she nestled, and drew her feet up under her. Yuki smiled at
the naïveté of it. Already she felt years older than her
mother. She took her place on a chair, drawing forward a
tabouret with smoking outfit, and urged her willing guest to
the luxury of a small pipe. A sense of freedom, of delight in
this sweet companionship, swept for the moment Yuki&#39;s
hovering responsibilities.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Okkasan, dear Okkasan (honorable mother), I am so
happy to be with you! But why did you wait so long?&quot; Her
voice was rich with tender reproving. &quot;Three long days!
Long as the castle moats when the mud is showing. The
prince is in this house but seldom. I have been lonely,
mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
&quot;Your father forbade me to write or visit you until official
request was made us. Now you are a princess, dear, and far
outrank Sir Onda&#39;s wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki flushed. Her eyes sank in embarrassment. &quot;Oh, I
had not heard of the strange fact. I beg your pardon, my
mother. I am ashamed that it is so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya laughed. &quot;Do you beg my pardon for being a princess,
for making your father proud and happy, when&mdash;when&mdash;he
was threatened by such disappointment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now Iriya, too, became embarrassed. She had intended not
to refer to unhappy topics of the past. Yuki was thinking
deeply. &quot;It must be honorably the same cause which keeps
my Gwendolen away.&quot; A great relief followed the thought.
The fear of coldness, of censure, was gone. She smiled into the
air before her, thinking of the letter she soon should write.</p>

<p class="indent">At first, unnoticed by her companions, old Suzumè had risen
from her corner and was trotting stealthily about the room.
She touched now, softly, each marvellous object within her
reach, and talked to herself, the while, in a queer little sing-song
monologue. &quot;Ma-a-a! the honorable, huge room, and the
wonderful things, all belonging to our Yuki-ko! Foreign carpets
with many-colored vegetables painted on them. Strange,
puffy beds, high up on legs, like horses (here she patted a
French sofa). High tables,&mdash;Ma-a-a! with little carpets on
them, too, all ravelled at the edges. Big glass wine-cups
(here she lifted an iridescent flower-vase)&mdash;merciful Buddha!
No wonder the august foreigners are so often drunk! Gold is
all about, on walls and furniture,&mdash;even the pictures have
little fences of gold around them! I see a big singing-box
(piano) over in the corner. That alone costs hundreds and
hundreds of yen. How rich our o jo san must be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya and Yuki, by this time, had begun to notice the antics
and to smile at the crooning of the old woman. She saw it,&mdash;nothing
escaped the arrow of those jetty orbs,&mdash;but it pleased
her now to pretend unconsciousness of observation. She placed
herself in front of Yuki, as if the young wife were a large
dressed doll, and could not listen. &quot;Ma-a-a! Our o jo san,
last of the Onda race. There she sits, straight and slim in her
foreign chair, just like our Gracious Empress herself when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
her photograph is taken! Now she is a princess, but once she
was only a little girl, carried to school on old Suzumè&#39;s bent
back. Tee-hee! My back is crooked now as Daruma,&mdash;but
a princess helped to crook it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t say such things, Suzumè!&quot; cried Yuki, quickly.
&quot;They hurt me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should it hurt you, Yuki-ko,&mdash;I mean, your Highness,
when old Suzumè is only proud?&quot; chuckled the beldame,
with almost malicious enjoyment. &quot;Let me be crooked, by
your favor. Let me hump over like the lobster of long life.
A princess curved my back, tee-hee! Ma-a-a! Will your
kind eyes moisten for such a thing? Arà! I have ceased. Behold
me now, your Highness,&mdash;straight and slim as a young
willow down by the moat.&quot; She threw back her shoulders and
swaggered comically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is better. How is it that little Maru did not come
to-day?&quot; asked Yuki, determined, if possible, to change the
current of the old soul&#39;s thought. Her effort was strikingly
successful. Simultaneously Suzumè&#39;s face and hands fell.
&quot;Ma-a-a! I am a fool. Moths have eaten my memory! Maru
crouches yet outside the street gate, waiting for permission to
enter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I, too, forgot. Kwannon, forgive my selfishness,&quot;
murmured Iriya.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, poor, poor Maru!&quot; cried the hostess, her face a bright
tangle, now, of smiles and tears, &quot;the cold wind blows down
that street. Go quickly, Suzumè. Fetch her, instantly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The spoiled old servant cast a cunning eye to an electric
bell set in its black wood disc. &quot;August Princess,&quot; she
whined, &quot;deign but to put your smallest finger upon that
white pebble yonder, and at once a fine man-servant will
enter. Maru will be much comforted to receive her summons
from a grand <i>man</i>-servant in foreign clothes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya&#39;s face showed vexation at the old servant&#39;s forwardness,
but Yuki laughed and touched the bell. She was beginning
to realize, in a sort of glad wonder, that her heart
grew lighter with every smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Maru came into the room sidewise. At every few steps
her knees apparently gave way. She did not know, in a foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
house, just when she was expected to kneel and bow, so
kept herself in readiness to drop at an instant&#39;s notice. Her
face was round, like a dish. Her beady eyes snapped and
sparkled with excitement. The small button of a nose, blown
on by unfriendly winds, glowed in the centre of her countenance
like an over-ripe cherry. At sight of Yuki, she found
her cue and grovelled. &quot;How is it?&quot; asked Yuki of her
mother, when Maru was at last persuaded to hold her head
erect, &quot;that, I not having yet written, you and the servants
came to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, did you not know of it? Prince Haganè sent, last
night, a special messenger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I had not heard. Prince Haganè is very kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the curious tone Iriya sent a keen look to her daughter.
She did not like the expression gathering on the down-bent
face. &quot;Come, my jewel, you have not shown us half the wonders
of your new home. Shall not Suzumè and Maru be given
bliss? We can stay but an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An hour!&quot; echoed the young wife, in dismay. &quot;That is
already half spent. Oh, mother, one hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such are your father&#39;s orders. You know we do not disobey
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki sighed. &quot;I know. Well, let us see all that we can
in the short space. This room is but the dining-room, where,
as you have seen, we eat foreign meals. There is a Japanese
wing and smaller dining-room, which I shall often use when
my master is absent. Now let us go into the long hall, then
into the zashiki, or drawing-room.&quot; In passing the hall-way
she saw Maru&#39;s eyes fasten on the telephone box. It had,
indeed, an unrelated, black look, set so squarely against the
flowered wall-paper. Yuki felt the tug on an inspiration.
&quot;Come, mother; I shall not need to write to my friend. I
shall talk to her through this! Like the old sennin (genii),
who whispered to each other from peak to crag of far mountains,
I shall talk clearly to the slope of Azabu!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Iriya caught her sleeve. &quot;I fear for you to talk in that
strange way, my child. The gods may not like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, mother, in America I have talked for hours and was
not injured.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
&quot;Our gods were not in America to see,&quot; murmured Iriya,
and followed with evident reluctance. Suzumè and Maru came
close behind. Yuki boldly pulled down the receiver and held
it to her ear. The servants uttered short squeaks like mice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Moshi, moshi!&quot; called Yuki, giving the Japanese telephone
cry.</p>

<p class="indent">Maru shuddered. &quot;Is it a deaf devil, that the o jo san
speaks so loudly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A whole nest of devils, Maru San,&quot; said Yuki, with mischievous
and impressive gravity. &quot;There are green and red
devils like those that the lightning bolts bring down, and
little foreign devils in boots and beards, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, let us go! let us go!&quot; cried the little maid, and
clutched Suzumè&#39;s sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;America no K&#333;shikwan,&quot; Yuki was replying, in apparent
unconcern, to the devils. Suzumè had realized the situation.
&quot;Fool!&quot; she said to the cringing Maru, giving a scowl and a
light cuff on the ear, &quot;the princess is only telegraphing in
talk instead of writing. The house-servants laugh at you.
We shall have no face!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the imperilled princess was talking rapidly in
English. Her countenance quivered, brightened, changed, as
if a person stood before her. In pause of listening she would
nod, smile, listen again, giving murmured ejaculations.</p>

<p class="indent">The verisimilitude proved too much for Maru. In spite of
cuffs fiercely renewed, and a desperate effort to keep her limp
body from the floor, she sank from her mentor&#39;s grasp, clutching
the thin old legs, and sobbing, &quot;They are bewitching our
Miss Yuki,&mdash;I know they are! Foxes are shut in that black
box! She will get full of them, and then they will all fly out
to eat our hearts!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;d have a sop of sour jelly with yours, cuttlefish!&quot;
said Suzumè, kicking in disgust. Finally, in utter exasperation,
she seized the culprit by the ear, sliding her bodily down
the hardwood floor, and depositing her in a moaning heap on
the back veranda beneath a water-cooler.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendolen, Gwendolen!&quot; Yuki was crying. &quot;I have
just now learned, I think, why you have not come or wrote to
me.&quot; (Pause.) &quot;Yes, it was just that thing,&mdash;my rank, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
called. Alas, do you remember, Gwendolen, that poor little
sea-maid how she feel when the proud grandmother beckoned
eight large oysters to fasten upon her scales? Well, I have
now the pinch of such oysters. But I will not care so much
if only you will come!&quot; (Pause.) &quot;My mother is with me, and
her servants, but they must go very soon. I will be alone.&mdash;Yes,
he is to be absent all the day. Oh, come quickly,&mdash;quickly,&mdash;I
cannot bear some more long waiting.&quot; Yuki
wheeled from the telephone. &quot;She will come, mother; my
friend will come! Let us go to the long drawing-room and
wait for her. I will send tea and cakes to comfort the silly
Maru. Some other day we shall see all of this big house.
It is very ugly, though costing much money. That is honorably
often the case with foreign things. Oh, mother, I have
been so hungry for you and my golden friend! She will be
brought to us in the long drawing-room. We are in heart and
soul, if not in race, true sisters. How kind she was to me at
school! I have written you before. The other girls would
tease me. They asked impertinent questions, and would
always be tormenting me to dance. Gwendolen was the only
one to see how I felt. She protected me, and would not let
me dance until my heart began to sing. She knew that real
dancing, like poetry, should come only when your heart sings,&mdash;not
just because you are requested. Sometimes in homesickness
I would dance, sometimes in joy of springtime
flowers. Those girls tried, too, to dance,&mdash;the funny American
girls! But they could never learn. Not even Gwendolen
could learn, though I taught and taught and taught
her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Excitement bred of the coming visit caught her up like a
leaf. Prattling on, she moved swiftly into the long room,
beckoning now and then for Iriya to follow. The mother kept
at quite a distance, embarrassed by this lack of restraint in a
married daughter. In the centre of the room the girl paused,
and, as if impelled, threw herself into a pose of wonderful
beauty, every bone, every inch of white flesh set, as it were,
into visible expression of a poetic thought. &quot;I did not know
that ever again I should wish to dance like this,&quot; Iriya heard
her murmur. &quot;Yes, I am coming back to myself. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
that little soul that fled on the ship,&mdash;it may come back last
of all, but it will come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Half dreamily she passed into a second pose. The transition
was music. Now her long eyes closed into a mere gleaming
thread, her lips parted, and trembled. Almost without
motion of her mouth she talked on, in broken Japanese
phrases, uttering them in rhythms, which subtly related to
the gestures of her body. &quot;No, those girls could never
dance,&mdash;never dance,&mdash;with their honorably stiff shoulders
and their limbs like trunks of young trees. They attempted
it with fervor, but they could not augustly dance. But I will
dance again, and my souls will listen. I will dance the dance
of the Sun Goddess and of morning, because my friend is
coming!&quot; She hummed, now, the tune and the words of a
famous classic. Iriya, completely under the spell, sank to
the floor in the attitude of a singer, caught up the rhythm, and
sang with her:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Night is where thou art not,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Oh, my beloved!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Night lies in the stone rolled close against thy door.</span><br />
<span class="i4">Let the sighs of spring,</span><br />
<span class="i4">(My sighing, oh, divine one,)</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let the salt waves&#39; weeping (my salt tears) allure thee!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The beautiful gestures flowed one into the next, like currents
of living water.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Lo, she awakens; light with shining fingers frets the dark rock fissure.</span><br />
<span class="i4">She approaches; see the black rock melt.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hark! listen!&quot; cried the dancer, and paused with arms
outspread. It was as if winds stood still, as if a flower-branch,
tossed in air, lost suddenly its power to return. Iriya caught
her breath. She too rose. Jinrikisha wheels were on the
gravel. &quot;My hour is gone,&quot; said Iriya; &quot;I know it from the
shadows. I will now return home, taking the servants with
me. You remain here, my child, and greet the friend who
now enters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I will remain here, mother, my dear, dear mother,
I will greet my friend,&quot; whispered the girl. The glamour of
the dance had swept back and held her. Half in the world of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
poetry, half in the material present, she wavered. The dawn
of her friend&#39;s coming shone through both. Iriya, with a last,
tender look, slipped from the room. Yuki&#39;s lip quivered like
a child&#39;s as she saw her mother go. But now, down the long
hall, came the tap-tap of high-heeled foreign shoes. A new
tremor stirred Yuki&#39;s lips, a little hint of fear hid in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen paused on the threshold. For a long moment
the two stood transfixed,&mdash;gazing, searching, each the face of
the other. Yes, a barrier had grown between them,&mdash;the
mystery of marriage, the recollection (on Gwendolen&#39;s part)
of unspeakable slanders, the ghostly, intangible stirring of
race antagonism, to which they themselves could not have
given name. Yuki began slowly to whiten, but Gwendolen,
with a backward toss of the head like Diana on a hilltop,
cried out aloud, &quot;My sister!&quot; and the two friends, crashing
through phantoms, found each other&#39;s arms. They clung
close, sobbing and swaying. Whispers started, but never
found conclusion. Names were repeated with every intonation
of deep love. &quot;My friend,&mdash;my Gwendolen!&quot; &quot;Yuki!
Yuki! Yuki!&quot; A dozen times they drew back, looked again,
and clung closer. Finally they succeeded in reaching a sofa,
and sat down, with hands still intertwined.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you, little you, are the mistress of all this great
house! You are to give receptions, and be the chief hostess. I
suppose you will chaperon <i>me</i>, you chicken! Isn&#39;t it a joke?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It do seem joky,&quot; admitted Yuki, with another sigh of
full content.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Madame la Princesse, may I give you now my first
social commission? I want a prince of my own,&mdash;a Japanese
prince. Let him be poor,&mdash;all the better,&mdash;but his trademark,
I mean his crest, I insist on having it warranted as the
real thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would then become of poor Mr. Dodge?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Dodge!&quot; echoed the other, with greatest scorn. &quot;You
certainly never had any idea I would look twice at Mr. Dodge!
Besides, he is making a fool of himself over that fat, ogling
Carmen Niestra. Ugh! She reminds me of a huge suet pudding
with sweet sauce. I always suspected Dodge of low
sentiments.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
&quot;I know not of this Miss Carmen,&quot; said Yuki, in a troubled
voice. &quot;But I like Mr. Dodge, always, very, very much; and
I am sure he loved you&mdash;distractionately!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That just about expresses it!&quot; cried Gwendolen; and
little Yuki never knew why her friend laughed so heartily,
while the dark shadow of an unspoken pain still clouded
her bright eyes. &quot;Let&#39;s change the subject,&quot; the American
said quickly. &quot;Dad told me to give you lots of love, and to
say that all of us were looking forward to that grand first
reception of yours. Next Thursday, isn&#39;t it? No, Friday.
We got our cards yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will come and assist me in the preparing, won&#39;t you,
dear Gwendolen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn&#39;t be kept away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Mrs. Todd, too. Your kind mother, will she not
come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen averted her face. &quot;The truth is, Yuki, mother
takes Pierre&#39;s part. Nothing that dad or I can say has influence.
That awful Mrs. Stunt owns mother now, body and
soul; and Mrs. Stunt has no tender feelings to spare for her
own sex.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not surprised at your mother, or even greatly hurt.
It is right that&mdash;he&mdash;should have friends to sympathize.
Say to your mother, please, that I do not resent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll say nothing of the kind!&quot; cried Gwendolen, indignantly.
&quot;It would please Mrs. Stunt too much. Oh, they
will be waiting to question me about you. Mrs. Stunt&#39;s eyes
will glare like those of a hungry hyena. I shall tell them
that you are superbly indifferent. That will fetch them!
Mrs. Stunt, as it is, will be the first to enter your reception-rooms,&mdash;the
odious little painted ghoul!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All brightness had faded from the young faces. Each
stared upon troubled visions. &quot;Since we are on such topics,
Yuki,&quot; Gwendolen began, &quot;I might as well tell you and have
done with it,&mdash;Pierre himself is acting like a spoiled child, a
cad. He wants to make trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His threat is to harm Prince Haganè, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! But who told you?&quot; She looked sharply at her
companion. Yuki apparently had not heard. Gwendolen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
went on. &quot;Dad simply laughs at him for a foolish blusterer.
He says a cricket might as well shake its fists at a grain
elevator.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no rumor at all that Pierre may go home to
France?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Absolutely none. Ronsard is using him as a cat&#39;s-paw.
Since your marriage Pierre has been openly announced Second
Secretary of the French Legation. A sinecure, but it gives him
entrée to all court functions,&mdash;to official receptions,&mdash;to&mdash;<i>your</i>
reception, Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have thought of this also,&quot; said Yuki. &quot;He could not
harm my husband in such an open place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but with that demon of a Ronsard behind him he
could embarrass, perhaps mortify, both you and Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki fell silent. Her slim hands clasped and unclasped
nervously. Her eyes were fixed on a spot of carpet near her
feet. &quot;Of course it is certain that so great statesman as
Haganè thought of all such dangers before he wished to marry
me,&quot; she murmured, as much to herself as her companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good gracious, Yuki Onda!&quot; broke in Gwendolen, with
startling abruptness. &quot;What are those fearful scars on your
hands? Did they torture you after all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen&#39;s shocked face and horrified tone expressed
more than she would willingly have admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s eyes flashed once. She drew her hands within her
sleeves. &quot;How can you say such silly thing? Nipponese do
not torture!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen, to hide her emotion (for she did not entirely
believe Yuki&#39;s vehement asseveration) sprang up and began
walking up and down the room, near the sofa where Yuki sat,
watching her. &quot;What is it that you were about to warn me
of Monsieur Le Beau?&quot; asked the latter, calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is weak&mdash;silly&mdash;sentimental; bleating all over the
place about his blighted hopes,&mdash;his ruined life. He makes
me ill!&quot; The girl was thankful to expend on the absent
Pierre indignation to which she dared not ascribe the real
source. Those gashes on her friend&#39;s small hands were
burned already on her own heart. It did not occur to her
that accident had caused them. In a time of such conflict,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
they must be, necessarily, the marks of cruelty and violence.
Yuki guessed the pent-up fount of passion in her friend, for
she remarked quite coolly, &quot;I assure you, Gwendolen, those
little scratches were made by me,&mdash;myself, on our garden
hedge. I was the stupidity. No one caused but myself. You
know I have never told to you an untruthful thing. As for
Monsieur Le Beau, he has all reasons for saying that I have
ruined his life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ruined his grandmother!&quot; cried the other. &quot;There you
are, looking meek again. No wonder that all men are bullies
when we turn coward at the first frown. I thank Heaven it
was no man, however, that made those scars on you. If it had
been&mdash;&quot; She stopped short, looking so fierce that Yuki had
to smile at her. &quot;Well, Amazon?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I hate all men!&mdash;young ones in particular. Pierre
thinks his heart is bleeding, but, after all, it is chiefly his precious
vanity. He don&#39;t like being jilted! Subtract vanity from
the average man and you don&#39;t leave much beside the fillings
of his front teeth. They are all alike! I know them!&quot; She
flung herself to the sofa and clasped her arms once more
tightly around her friend. The outburst had relieved her;
but a new sadness came. Yuki was still very pale. A little
pathetic drooping had begun to show at the corners of her lips.
Gwendolen was by nature the antagonist of resignation. She
hated the dawning look of it on Yuki&#39;s face. &quot;Yuki, Yuki,
shall we ever be happy again as we were at school? Yet
we were restless there. All our thoughts flew westward, far, far
westward, and over that broad ocean, to your Japan. We
could never be really happy, we thought, until we had reached,
together, this country of your birth. Oh, it is beautiful, as
you told me! Each day its beauty deepens. I know now
what you meant by yama-buki fountains all of gold,&mdash;and
the wide, still yellow lakes of &#39;na.&#39; In our Legation garden
the cherry-trees are crusted over with tiny pointed rubies,
which soon&mdash;yes, very soon&mdash;must turn to flowers. All that
I see is beautiful, and yet, Yuki, think in how short a time
life has brought us both deep sorrow!&quot; She drew a sigh, the
long, luxurious, despairing sigh of untried youth. Yuki,
having griefs more real, echoed it in softer cadence.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
&quot;Yes, the cherry-buds will open, and the fountain of your
yama-buki toss, no matter what we are feeling! Is it not
kind to be so? I have heard that your Legation garden is not
very&mdash;harmonious. Will there be many bright spring flowers
in it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The garden is a blot, but it is a big blot, and things grow
there, thank Heaven! Haven&#39;t you ever been to the American
Legation at all? Yuki, I have an idea!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; Yuki had answered. At the new sparkle of excitement
in the fair face she unconsciously sat more erect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have an idea!&quot; Gwendolen repeated. &quot;You are now
your own mistress. Why can&#39;t you drive home with me, and
give mother a surprise? Nothing would soften her like that,&mdash;the
Princess Haganè to call in person!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, I will do that thing!&quot; cried Yuki, taking fire at
once. &quot;How clever you are, Gwendolen! I would sit here
mourning for the month and not have such bright idea. I tell
you, listen! We will send your jinrikisha off, then you stays
to luncheon with me, and after luncheon we takes the pumpkin
and some rats and turn them into a great coach with
horses, and drive off in splendor, like two little Cinderellas,
to your mother&#39;s house! Oh, what jolliness! let us go upstairs
and remove your hat!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; cried the other, in mock astonishment, &quot;you have
an upstairs, and beds for me to fling my wraps upon, and a
brush and comb, perhaps, for me to rearrange my locks!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come see!&quot; challenged Yuki. They ran off together,
Yuki darting up the steps, Gwendolen catching at her flying
heels, both laughing, giggling, uttering short shrieks.
&quot;Well,&quot; panted the American, sitting prone upon the top
step, &quot;it seems that life is going to be worth living after all!&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Except</span> in rare cases the ceremony of marriage among Japanese
is still unmodified by foreign innovation. These people
prefer to regard it as the most intimate of social functions, a
family sacrament, a transition to be made in grave silence, not
in the buzz of comment. Congratulations may follow, they
never precede, a wedding.</p>

<p class="indent">In the case of Prince Haganè, his official necessity for a wife
appeared significantly enough in the engraved cards of invitation,
sent out by hundreds, to announce weekly receptions
(beginning with a certain Friday) held by the Prince and
Princess Sanètomo Haganè in the residence of the Minister of
War. That word &quot;War,&quot; printed so smoothly among high-sounding
titles, bore little relation to the dark clouds of conflict
pouring in about Port Arthur and spreading a sombre pall
above Manchuria. Dark, too, was the shadow cast upon the
hearts of loyal Nipponese. For a lull had come, a mysterious
silence. Explanations were not offered to the people. Dead
bodies or fragments of bodies, were still brought home for
burial; new troops, by midnight, threaded city streets and
crowded the railway stations, bound for the front, yet no sounds
of battle came. It was as if a wheel had stopped, throwing
out the entire mechanism of a well-ordered campaign. At the
Imperial Palace in Tokio conferences were held daily, Haganè,
of course, being present. Sometimes Sir Charles Grubb and
his American colleague were called.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki noted the deepening gloom on her husband&#39;s brow. In
his scant hours of home-staying he seemed, now, only half-conscious
of her existence or its relation to himself. Once or
twice he had roused himself to answer kindly enough some
question of hers regarding the coming reception.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Gwendolen and the young wife were together
daily. The &quot;old times&quot; at Washington, to which they so often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
tenderly referred, as to an epoch centuries removed, gave
promise of recrudescence. They laughed, giggled, ate olives,
made fudge, and otherwise enjoyed themselves. If the
absence of Pierre and the buoyant Dodge saddened at times
these innocuous revelries, each girl hid her own regret.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd, as Gwendolen prophesied, had melted instantly.
The friendly visit of the Princess Haganè, the gentle pleading
of the schoolgirl Yuki, unchanged in spite of her new glittering
husk of rank, surprised that small camp of prejudices
in its sleep, and soon waved a bright laugh of victory. At
the next visit of Mrs. Stunt, however, before the Medusa-like
disapprobation of that noble countenance, Mrs. Todd
froze timidly again, to be again sun-thawed by Yuki, and
recongealed by Mrs. Stunt, until the will-power of the good
lady took on, through too frequent tempering, not, indeed,
the elasticity of a Damascene blade, but rather the pithiness
of an honest vegetable left in a winter nook.</p>

<p class="indent">During a softened interval Mrs. Todd had promised to stand
in Yuki&#39;s receiving line. Even at the moment she had given
a few sentimental sighs for Pierre, and made a mental reservation
that she would &quot;explain&quot; to his satisfaction. When
Mrs. Stunt turned a hard, reproving eye, she fain would have
rescinded altogether, but this time both Mr. Todd and Gwendolen
upheld her. Thus bravely seconded, she dared for once
defy her mentor. Mrs. Stunt made gestures of acrid resignation,
and turned her face away. During the afternoon she
concocted several choice paragraphs for &quot;The Hawk&#39;s Eye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A clear, blue day in early March dawned for Yuki&#39;s first
reception. Sunshine coaxed new flowers from the springing
lawn, and rolled apples of joyous discord among the crows and
sparrows. The two chief decorators, Gwendolen and Yuki,
had not dared to rely on the day for external brightness.
Draperies added to the long shapeless windows hung ready to
exclude sunshine and storm alike. At Gwendolen&#39;s suggestion,
candles and quaint candelabra were to give the key-note
to decoration. Old junk-shops and second-hand dealers in
temple brasses had been rummaged with rich results. Branching
clusters of tapers sprang everywhere from plain spaces on
the walls. Standing candelabra and quaint single candlesticks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
occupied tables, mantels, and the tops of cabinets and
book-shelves, alternating with bowls and vases of cut flowers.
The wall-lights, placed tactfully but a few feet above the
head of an average man, threw into softened shadow the vast
and disproportionate ceiling. Yuki&#39;s delight was pleasant to
witness. She never could have dreamed&mdash;as she often told
her friend&mdash;that the old lecture-hall could look so well. The
garish hangings and unspeakable oil-paintings became inconspicuous,
and were further softened by wreaths of smilax
and other imported hot-house vines. As the opening hour
approached, Yuki became more and more excited, though her
efforts after matronly calm were apparent. Even the knowledge
that Pierre would certainly come that afternoon should
not daunt her. Nothing had been heard from him since that
one interview at Kamakura. Of this Yuki had not spoken,
not even to Gwendolen. Well, let him come, and give her
pain! She deserved it! Still would friends be left, Gwendolen,
and Mr. Todd, and the dear mother, Iriya, and&mdash;and
her husband, Haganè. Her troubled heart faced round to
him, but it was as if she stood before a stone precipice. He
was too great; she too close.</p>

<p class="indent">All through the forenoon of that busy day presents had
been arriving. The flood-gates of official recognition had been
thrown wide. Gifts of flowers, of fruit in wonderful baskets,
of growing plants in exquisitely glazed hana-bachi, came in
embarrassing confusion. Baron Tsukeru, who united a passion
for Japanese peonies to a more exotic devotion to orchids,
sent a great lacquered tray heaped with broken rainbows,
hoar-frost, and strange, flying insects turned to flowers. Old
Prince Shìrota, who had been present at their marriage, sent
to the prince and his new princess a box of eggs, together
with a humorous poem, saying, &quot;May each smooth egg betoken
a life of wedded happiness, and may each year bring an heir.
So shall joy and the house of Haganè be immortal!&quot; A cabinet
minister sent a case of champagne, also with a poem; but his
was paraphrased from Tennyson. Sweetmeats, oranges, and
loose flowers came literally by cartloads.</p>

<p class="indent">The great central offering, however, was a heap of exquisitely
wrought confection representing blue waves, with a pair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
of Miyako-dori, birds symbolic of conjugal felicity, floating
upon the sugared sea. This gift, placed reverently upon a
little table to itself, needed no card. Upon the unpainted
side of the satin-wood box in which it was fashioned, shone
the Imperial insignia, a gold chrysanthemum with sixteen
petals.</p>

<p class="indent">The master, twice during the forenoon, had rolled up to the
door in his carriage, gone into his private office, closed the
doors tightly, and busied himself with desk-drawers and
papers. In a few moments he emerged and drove away without
having spoken. On a third visit, he came into the drawing-room,
in search of Yuki. She and Gwendolen were at the
far end, both looking upward and talking (one in English,
one in Japanese) to a bewildered servant on a stepladder,
who paused to listen, his face copper-yellow among the loops
of smilax. Neither heard Haganè until he was fairly upon
them. Yuki gave a start; but Gwendolen brought down level
eyes and smiled at him. He spoke first to the guest, holding
her hand closely for an instant, and uttering some conventional,
though, in this case, sincere expressions of gratitude
for her kindness to Yuki. He then asked of Yuki the exact
hour at which the reception was to commence. He spoke in
English. &quot;Four, your Highness,&quot; answered Yuki, in the
same tongue. &quot;I shall be in this apartment at four,&quot; he
said, and then took his departure.</p>

<p class="indent">The two friends watched through the window as he stepped
under the porte cochère and entered the carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your husband is a king among men, my Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does not become a Japanese wife to admit so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The hair he leaves on his barber&#39;s floor tingles with more
manliness than the whole body of Pierre Le Beau.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does not become the one who has made Pierre suffer to
say so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw! Nonsense! He enjoys his suffering. But of
course I might have known you would make some such retort.
Do you want me to try to keep him away from you this afternoon,
or is it part of your penitence to assist him in insulting
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, help keep away, if you can!&quot; gasped Yuki. &quot;Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
Haganè will be standing by me then. I wish most of all for
him not to be annoyed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder whether you realize, small Princess&mdash;&quot; Gwendolen
began, then suddenly stopped. Her look, as she scrutinized
the upturned face, was singular; her tone, more
curious still. She closed her lips tightly now, as if to forbid
the thought to come, shook her blonde head, and facing back
to the window tapped a hollow rhythm on the pane.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s cheeks grew hot. &quot;Some one&mdash;some one need me,
I think,&quot; she murmured, and literally ran from the room.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Prince Haganè, punctual to the instant, fresh from the
hands of his man-servant, impressive, unforgettable, in dark
native robes of silk, took his place at the head of the receiving
line. Yuki wore a robe and obi of splendid brocade, too heavy
for an unmarried woman, but now befitting the dignity of a
peeress. The colors were her favorite gray and pink, shot
through with threads of silver. In her dark hair were pink
orchids, the living flowers. She wore no jewelry but a broad
gold band on her wedding finger,&mdash;a concession to her Christian
principles,&mdash;and a clasp to her obi-domè, or flat silken cord
which holds the great folds in place. This clasp represented
intertwisted dragons. Like the ivory pin which she and Pierre
had broken, it was an heirloom in her father&#39;s family.</p>

<p class="indent">The new kinswoman, little Princess Sada-ko, was to be near
her, above Gwendolen in the line, but lower than the matron,
Mrs. Todd. Mr. Todd had &quot;begged off.&quot; So also had Yuki&#39;s
parents. Onda, in fact, spurred by his dread of meeting
foreigners, found good pretext for visiting a village nearly a
day&#39;s ride away.</p>

<p class="indent">Guests had not begun to arrive. Even the Todds (Gwendolen
had gone home two hours before to change her dress) had
not yet made appearance. Haganè stood quietly in his place,
and let his gaze move slowly through the changed and decorated
rooms. The candles gleamed with intense yet softened
brilliancy. In an adjoining parlor he could see the corner of
a long table spread with rich food. Servants in livery moved
about, noiseless as shadows. A distant door was opened.
The flames of the candles leaned all one way, fretted a little,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
then stood upright. A few drops of wax trickled over to the
floor. Instantly a servant came with knife and saucer to
scrape up the hardening substance.</p>

<p class="indent">The old Prince Shirota sat in a low chair near the fire, with
a late American magazine on his silken knees. Iriya hovered
near, devouring with proud eyes this vision of her daughter
consorting on equal terms with princes. Servants stole everywhere,
soft, sleek, gentle, like well-fed animals.</p>

<p class="indent">A curious expression grew in the eyes of Haganè. His
mouth writhed into a harsh and ugly smile which did not pass.
Yuki felt the change in him, glanced up, and shrank a few
inches further from his side. He did not notice her. He had
been reading, but a few hours before, the written report of a
Japanese spy, one of the few who had escaped alive from the
very citadel of Port Arthur. The conditions of that fortress
were plainly stated: food in abundance, ammunition,
men, stone walls practically impregnable, a brave man in
command,&mdash;all things in Russian favor; and yet by Japanese
life that stronghold must be taken, by death the national
honor be restored. As their Emperor read, and laid the paper
down, he had bent his head, as if praying, and one hand had
covered his down-bent eyes. Haganè shivered at that memory.
Hunger, privation, cold, the agony of wounds untended, the
deeper agony of remembered little ones soon to be fatherless,
praying now in distant mountain villages,&mdash;this must the
Japanese know to full measure. Food and shelter in Manchuria
could alleviate, and for such alleviation, money was the
only aid. Food, clothing, shelter, ammunition! Why, the
very candles fanning out a brief existence on these walls
would feed a brave battalion for a week! The table yonder,
spread with delicacies for foreigners already gorged,&mdash;that
long table would bring peace nearer by a hundred cannon detonations.
The outer world, civilization so-called, demanded
that tawdry ostentation still show her front.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Lord&mdash;your Highness,&quot; whispered Yuki, barely touching
his sleeve, &quot;has aught offended you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked down into her anxious face. His noble scorn
melted into sadness. &quot;Nay, Yuki, I was but counting the
lives of soldiers by these candles on the wall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
&quot;Lord, so have I thought, even to the point of weeping;
yet you had told me to make some display, to have things
fair to look on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I blame you not, my good child. There is no fault at all
in you; yet the smell of that rich food sickens me. I long
to be in the field with men; to share their handful of cold
rice, their shred of salted fish. I hate the silk upon me,
the soft rug at my feet, the smiling servants,&mdash;how can they
smile? When the foreign manikins arrive, it will be hard
fighting for me not to laugh at them,&mdash;to throw, like some
stung cuttle-fish, the inky substance of my scorn&mdash;why
should they laugh and feast? But, little one, I rave. You
have never heard the old volcano growl before? Well, I
shall be calm now; let us draw pink clouds about me, and
set spring flowers among the fissures of my soul.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear you not, my Lord, I but adore your spirit. I,
too, in my weak woman&#39;s way, have had a thought. Shall we
not purchase less rich food another time, and fewer candles?
Instead, I shall buy thread and cloth and cotton. I will this
very day invite the women here to weekly meeting for sewing.
Princess Sada has been telling me that many are already
started. We can make bandages, clothing, cover for your
brave men. Into the texture we shall weave our very hearts.
Tears of pity may, indeed, soothe noble wounds no less than
the ointment of our surgeons. Shall it not be so, my husband?
May I speak to my friends to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè had lifted one hand to his mouth while she made
eager speech. It was steady enough when he answered.
&quot;You have pleased me, little one, greatly have you pleased
me. I shall speak of this even to our Sacred Sovereigns.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen came bounding in like a child. &quot;Do you recognize
me, Yuki?&quot; she cried, pitching her long cloak backward.
&quot;Of course Prince Haganè would not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stood before the two, a shimmering vision of white,
touched at intervals by gleams of primrose hue. Haganè
smiled. &quot;If I mistake not greatly, it is the entire costume
worn by Miss Todd when first I was honored to make her
acquaintance. You called the ball a débutante&#39;s I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heavens, Yuki, think of his remembering! I see now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
Prince Haganè, that you are truly a great man. What on
earth have you been doing to your prince?&quot; she added in a
lower tone, as Haganè stepped forward to greet Mr. and Mrs.
Todd. &quot;He doesn&#39;t look a day over thirty-five, and handsome&mdash;He
is the noblest-looking man that ever I saw!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd, resplendent in her favorite mauve satin, violently
adorned in butter-colored lace, took her place next to Yuki.
She liked well the importance of the position, yet kept furtive
glances scurrying toward the door in outlook for Pierre and
Mrs. Stunt. It was the apparition of the latter that she
dreaded most. She trembled in recalling Mrs. Stunt&#39;s threat
of forbidding and condemnatory conduct. &quot;Not in Yuki&#39;s own
house, my dear Mrs. Stunt,&quot; she had pleaded. &quot;Don&#39;t go to
the reception at all if you disapprove so of their behavior.
Wait until you meet them outside.&quot; To this Mrs. Stunt had
replied only by tight lips, and a glance of incorruptible virtue,
as one who should say, &quot;Get thee behind me, Satan!&quot; Mrs.
Todd envied her friend the rigidity of her moral nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Stunt came among the very first. Although small in
stature, she never failed to make herself conspicuous. She had
acquired an air of patronage, of condescension. If a person
or a group of persons continued to converse within the first
few moments of her appearance, she had a way of looking at
the offenders, of singling them out, that was never thereafter
forgotten. On this occasion she was resplendent in a new
gown of silvery gray silk, very tight as to bust and hip, and a
trifle scanty as to skirt. A reason for this insufficiency showed
in the yokes and sleeves of the Misses Stunt, lank, timid damsels
of fifteen and thirteen respectively, who followed with
unquestioning eyes their energetic mother. Each had a pinkish
frock hung from a &quot;guimpe&quot; of silvery gray.</p>

<p class="indent">Kind-hearted Mrs. Todd literally held her breath as this
important person bore, like a small nickel-plated naphtha
launch, straight to the dark sea-rock of her host. The tight
gray waist had the sheen of armor. Mrs. Todd watched for
the steely reflection in her friend&#39;s bright eyes. They were
now lifted to the face of Haganè. But no!&mdash;barbed lightnings
did not flash admonition from their depths. Never were
blue china beads more free from righteous indignation than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
those upraised orbs. She literally grovelled, first at the feet
of Lord Haganè, then before his bride. Yuki received her
gushing compliments with unsmiling lips. This made no
difference. The Misses Stunt were then signalled to grovel.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd&#39;s mouth, opened in incredulity during this brief
scene, had forgotten to close. Something like indignation
tingled through her full veins. Was Mrs. Stunt after all the
hypocrite Gwendolen said she was? &quot;Mrs. Stunt!&quot; she called
eagerly. Surely some explanation could be made.</p>

<p class="indent">The valiant one swept by her with a nod. She gave but
one short sentence, back-flung, &quot;Dear Mrs. Todd, how very
warm you&#39;re looking!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Princess Sada, whose title Gwendolen took pains to enunciate
distinctly, came in for her share of compliment. The
American girl next her, half-angry, half-hysterical with suppressed
laughter, was hastily whittling a mental arrow, her
keen eye searching, meanwhile, for some weak spot in the self-love
of her foe. Mrs. Stunt, scenting trouble,&mdash;her perceptions
in this regard were canine,&mdash;would have avoided the
girl, but farther down the line were more Japanese. Another
princess might be stowed among them. Mrs. Stunt
could not relinquish a possible princess. She gathered up her
mantle of effrontery, and went to her doom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mrs. Stunt, not that high, fashionable hand-shake
between old friends,&quot; cried the clear, sweet voice. Guests
now poured into the doors. Many paused to hear the next
sound of that pleasing voice. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you how glad I
am that you have met at last my friend Yuki, the Princess
Haganè! You have talked so much about her, and now you
have really met. I saw Yuki&#39;s joy in the meeting. You were
intoxicating in your sincerity, dear Mrs. Stunt, a pewter-mug
literally frothing with felicitations! Why, and here is Miss
Stunt and Miss Leonora Stunt! Yes, I am glad to see you
both; but move on, children; you must get mama to bring
you with her on some of her frequent visits to the Legation!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Stunt carried her tarnished pewter bravely down the
line. She was actually dull, leaden-toned with rage. It was
not so much Gwendolen&#39;s impertinence that stung her, but
the fact of the loud, clear voice, pitched for all to share.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
Whatever Mrs. Stunt&#39;s good opinion of herself, she could not
but realize that most of those who overheard rejoiced in the
Stunt humiliation.</p>

<p class="indent">The moment she had spoken, Gwendolen regretted it. &quot;A
mean, tawdry, contemptible bit of revenge!&quot; she muttered to
herself. &quot;I feel already nearly as vile as she.&quot; The girl
looked up to meet her father&#39;s deep-set eyes. A pathetic
little moue, a single pleading gesture, and the tenderness
returned to them; but his first look rankled.</p>

<p class="indent">It had been decided between Mr. Todd and his daughter
that he should remain near some door or window in the thick
of arriving-time, where at each loud carriage entrance he
could draw aside the drapery and try to recognize the equipage.
When the French coat-of-arms appeared he was to
signal Gwendolen. Of course Le Beau would accompany his
chief. The two now were inseparable. The only plan which
Gwendolen&#39;s thought had suggested was to intercept Pierre
at the door, and with what wit and invention then came to
her aid, try to separate him from his evil genius, Ronsard,
and, if possible, keep him away from Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge entered airily alone. He wore a crimson carnation
in his buttonhole and dove-gray &quot;spats&quot; above his patent
leather shoes. Seldom now did he accompany the Todd
family to any social function. Gwendolen had been asked by
her parents the cause of this sudden aloofness, and they had
received in turn the ambiguous and not altogether respectful
reply, &quot;How should I know? Am I our secretary&#39;s keeper?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge paused now near the door through which he had
entered. The rooms were filling rapidly. His clear, dog-like
eyes of hazel brown threaded the crowd, resting the fraction
of an instant on each form. He searched, apparently, for
some special object. Gwendolen, in her pretty débutante&#39;s
gown which should, by rights, have evoked pensive memories,
received but the usual light stroke of observation. The brown
eyes shot on past her, swept around the walls, came back to
the door where the owner of them stood, and then turned
about to the entrance hall. &quot;Ah!&quot; said Dodge, under his
breath. The eagerness of the sound carried it to Gwendolen&#39;s
ear. She saw him disappear. A moment later he re-entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
with Carmen Gil y Niestra, languid and beautiful, in cream
lace and crimson carnations.</p>

<p class="indent">The two young people came down the line together. Yuki
gazed with some curiosity on the face of the Spanish
girl. Gwendolen waited for them. She held herself like a
young Empress receiving coronation felicitations. The white
débutante&#39;s dress seemed to become alive as Dodge neared it.
One long tulle fold streamed after him as he went by.
Gwendolen caught at it angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Todd touched his daughter on the shoulder. She
slipped out quietly to the hall-way, threw on the long dark
cloak she had left there for the purpose, and was in the doorway
before the French barouche had entirely stopped. Pierre
issued first, and without having observed her, stood ready to
assist his chief. He gave a nervous start as Gwendolen touched
him. &quot;Let the count go in alone,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I must
speak with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The minister now emerged, a pendulous and unstable bulk.
Gwendolen flew to his side. He looked into a face vital with
excitement, hurt pride, vague apprehension. Her eyes were
fairly black, her usually pale cheeks, red as Carmen&#39;s flowers.
Her beauty smote the old sensualist with delight. &quot;Mon
Dieu, Mademoiselle, but you are lovely,&quot; he murmured partly
to himself. Ignoring physical disadvantages, he paused to
make her a deep and courtly bow, his hand pressed reverently
upon that portion of his torso where, beneath layers of unhealthy
fat, squatted the small toad of his heart with the
cross of the Legion of Honor about its neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad that you think me lovely at this moment,&quot; said
the girl, coquettishly, swallowing hard her rising disgust. &quot;I
want you to help me. Please go in without Pierre. Do not
let the usher call his name just yet. I must speak alone
with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Count Ronsard&#39;s admiration was supplemented by a shrewd
and contaminating look. He and Pierre crossed glances.
The minister bowed again, this time with less ceremony.
&quot;Whatever beauty asks is already granted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He whispered something to a servant who had stepped up
to take Pierre&#39;s place. The servant hurried in before. Ronsard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
climbed heavily, alone, the two stone steps of the portico.
Gwendolen had drawn near Le Beau, when the bawl of
the usher, in a voice unusually loud and distinct, arrested
her. &quot;His Excellency Count Ronsard, Minister of France,
Monsieur Pierre Le Beau, Second Secretary to the French
Legation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen caught her breath. Her eyes began to blaze.
At this instant Count Ronsard, now on the top step, gave a cry,
tottered, and would have fallen but for Pierre&#39;s agile spring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My ankle, my infernal ankle! I have sprained, perhaps
broken it!&quot; he groaned aloud in English. &quot;Your arm, my
son, I cannot walk alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus supported, he limped heavily into the drawing-room.
Yuki hurried to meet him. A low cushioned chair was
wheeled for his convenience. He dominated at once the
entire assemblage. Formal greetings ceased. Half a dozen
different nationalities crowded in to inquire about the accident.
He and Pierre took turns in explanation. French, German,
Spanish, Italian, English, Japanese, each was answered courteously
in his own tongue. Yuki sent upstairs to her medicine-case
for bandages and liniment; but this attention the gallant
count repelled. His boot would keep the swelling down,
he said, until the sick chamber of his own house could be
reached.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen let fall her cloak in the hall way; whoever
would might rescue it. Slowly she entered the drawing-room,
paused near the interesting group about the sufferer, and stood
watching, her whole slight frame in a hot tingle with impotent
anger. No mark of pain rested on the flabby countenance of
Ronsard. Pierre looked far more ill. This fact but added to
Gwendolen&#39;s uneasiness. Yuki had a tender heart for human
suffering. She heard the count&#39;s brave self-control admired,
and her disgust turned to a mental nausea. For the moment
no counter-stroke occurred to her. Even the keen eyes of
Prince Haganè were, apparently, deceived. He stood near the
Frenchman expressing grave concern. Yuki, perforce, remained
within calling of her afflicted guest. Haganè at
length moved off. Pierre, Ronsard, and Yuki were together,
a meeting that Gwendolen had striven against, and plotted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
prevent. Gwendolen fancied that her schoolmate already
turned more wan, that she trembled and shrank from the low
words that were spoken. She was a white dove picked upon
by vultures. Mrs. Stunt stood across the room gleaning items
with her steely gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">Discomfited, utterly worsted, Gwendolen trailed slow steps
down the lighted vista. She longed for her father, but now
he and Prince Haganè had begun to talk. A vacant window,
half-hidden in trailing vines, allured her. She hurried to it,
threw aside the curtain, and looked out into the deepening
twilight. All of this fair March day had been blue and windless.
The night was a bowl of liquid sapphire, a deep aerial
sea into which the house had been lowered, like a great illuminated
bell. So tangible, so intense, was the outer blueness
that it seemed to Gwendolen, should she lift the sash an inch,
a gentian tide must gurgle in through the fissure, steal along
the wall to the shadowy floor, and silently fill the long rooms
with a purple flood.</p>

<p class="indent">That moment brought to the girl her first tinge of worldly
bitterness. Heretofore, with the one exception of her quarrel,
things had seemed naturally to come right just because she
wished it. Even in dreams, things always came right for her.
Now, by some shabby turn of fortune, the reverse was true;
failure marked every effort. Being young, healthy, and
totally unacquainted with real sorrow, it was inevitable that
she should luxuriate in an imaginary despair. She stared into
the night, envying its cool blue depths of silence and oblivion.
She raised long lashes to the stars, gleaming faintly now like
small phosphorescent mushrooms springing on a damp blue
field, and wondered, sighing, whether on those distant planets
lived any girl so miserable as she.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Todd,&quot; murmured a low voice. She wheeled back
to the lighted room with a gesture so sudden that two large
tears splashed upon her cheeks. Dodge stood beside her half-abashed,
altogether eager, deeply flushed by the late battle
with his pride. Gwendolen&#39;s heart gave a bound toward him,
then sank down whimpering. The girl, too, felt an overwhelming
need for tears. One kind word more from Dodge,
one faint concession on her part, and she must surrender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
utterly, bend down with her face hidden, and sob out her
anxieties and her relief. Oh, if they were but alone, and
she could &quot;make up&quot; as she longed to do! But now, because
all eyes might turn to them, because she had not the self-control
to explain, his tenderness must be met by scorn, in self-protection
she must lash herself to stoicism by blows rained
on him. She drew herself upright. He could not see how
feverishly one primrose-colored hand clutched the window-frame.
&quot;You have&mdash;mis-taken your&mdash;corner, Mr. Dodge,&quot;
she jerked out in a voice that needed to balance every word,
like an acrobat on a wire. &quot;Miss Niestra is, I think, in another
part of the room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have, as you say, mistaken the corner. I shall not offend
again,&quot; said Dodge.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl&#39;s heart called out after him. She bit her lips to
keep back the gush of tears. &quot;Now he will hate me forever
and ever! He&#39;ll never want to speak to me again,&quot; she told
herself. She threw her head back, and stepped out into the
light. Scrutiny would help to steady her. Count Ronsard
still held court, his two attendants being Pierre and Yuki.
Gwendolen&#39;s generous heart flared into new anger for her
friend. &quot;What are my stings to Yuki&#39;s!&quot; she cried to herself.
&quot;Those two men are devils to torture a woman as I
know they are doing!&quot; Gwendolen felt a sense of returning
energy. She had found a definite task.</p>

<p class="indent">Count Ronsard, who flattered himself that he understood all
women, to whom raw débutantes were as glass candy jars in a
village shop-window, felt a little surprise, perhaps even a
little excitement, as Gwendolen, smiling like a tall white
angel, bore down upon him, and announced, in her sweetest
voice, that she had come to &quot;keep him company.&quot; Enlightenment
and a challenge lay in her two next sentences. &quot;Bring
me that footstool, Pierre. Yuki, darling, let me take your
place now as ministering angel to the count. Other guests
may need you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Like a snowy bird of Paradise flecked with gold, she
perched beside the caged Frenchman. He saw through her
feint as clearly as she had seen through his. Having avowed
himself incapable of walking, he had no choice but to remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
where he was, or to return home. In sheer intellectual delight
at the girl&#39;s wit and daring, he yielded himself to her snare.
Her sentences enwrapped him in bright skeins. Excitement
gave her pungency. She realized that she had never talked
so well, and even in the midst of it regretted that it had to be
wasted on an &quot;old pig.&quot; Pierre hovered about sullenly until
released by a nod from his chief. No further speech did he
obtain with Yuki. Gwendolen noted, with malicious satisfaction,
how close the young wife kept to her husband&#39;s side, how
tenderly the great man leaned and spoke with her. Together
they now moved through the crowded rooms, delivering invitations
to the sewing-meeting on the following Monday, the
first to be held. The air of the room crackled to eager acceptances.
Mrs. Stunt&#39;s was the explosion of a small torpedo.
Tranquillity and her usual pale-rose flush came back to the
face of the little princess. Gwendolen&#39;s sparkling eyes jeered
light into those of Count Ronsard. The man was a great
man in his distorted way. As yet life&#39;s greatest values
were, for him, of the mind. Rising at last with ostentatious
and smothered groans, as he prepared to limp to his waiting
carriage, he gave the girl her meed of praise. &quot;Mademoiselle,&quot;
he said gravely, &quot;it would be a happy day for France
were you to become the wife of one of her diplomats.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Merci,&quot; said Gwendolen, with a French curtsy. &quot;The
profession allures me, but&mdash;an American diplomat will be
good enough for me!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A short</span> whispered colloquy between Haganè, the little
Princess Sada-ko, and Yuki, during the reception, a few
days before, resulted in the decision that the Japanese ladies
should be asked to come quite early to the sewing party;
the foreign contingent to be bidden later, about one in the
afternoon. To all Japanese the early hours of the day
are best. Yuki knew that this was not the case with foreigners.
Besides, to have served a hot foreign luncheon to
an indefinite number of guests would have taken from the
purpose of such a meeting most of its charitable intent, and,
very likely, all of the material profit. The simplest of Japanese
collations,&mdash;a bowl of thin fish soup, rice, tea, a fairy
dish of pickles, one sweetmeat, maybe, this could be served
with propriety to the Empress herself, had that gracious
lady been present. These women worked for their own
hero soldiers, for their own adored Nippon. Their utmost
efforts were privileges; what the foreign ladies gave might,
among themselves, be considered alms.</p>

<p class="indent">When all had arrived, that is, the foreigners as well as Japanese,
they were to be given for entertainment, music of the
two worlds. First, English songs from a charming soprano, a
Mrs. Wyndham of Yokohama, justly celebrated in the East,
as in her own land, for an unusually pure and lovely voice.
For Japanese they were to have improvisation and martial
chanting from a Satsuma biwa player, a court musician in
highest favor with their Majesties. The lending of him to
Yuki for this meeting had been a royal answer to Haganè&#39;s
modest statement of his young wife&#39;s plan.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese ladies, mostly of the noble class, began to
arrive before the blue morning mists had quite lifted from
the long, gleaming surfaces of castle moats; before the wild
white herons, perching on great down-sweeping arms of castle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
pines, had warmed their chilly feathers to the skin; before
the budding cherry-boughs had dared unfold a single dripping
leaf. By eight o&#39;clock that end of the huge upstairs hall set
apart for their exclusive use had few vacant places. The
Japanese ladies brought scissors, thimble, and needles; material
and thread were contributed by Prince Haganè. Yuki&#39;s
mother was among the first. Iriya grew younger and prettier
with each day, in this new pride and happiness won through
her only child. She had not brought the servants. Yuki
insisted that they be sent for. They came as upon the
chariot of the wind, released by a gruff sound of acquiescence
from their master, their blue sleeves flying horizontally
in the morning air. Little Maru, whose excessive
love for candy kept her in a condition of pink rotundity,
gasped joyously for breath. &quot;Ma-a-a!&quot; she cried at first
sight of a courtyard filled with crested kuruma; and
&quot;Ma-a-a!&quot; again, as she tripped on the top step and fell
full-length into the hall; and &quot;Ma-a-a!&quot; once more as the
obliging butler stooped to rescue her, until Suzumè, frowning
heavily, called her a bean-curd, and bade her cease
exclaiming.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a gentle company that worked in the upper hall.
Shining black heads bent as one above tumultuous yards
of white cotton cloth. The peculiar odor of cambric and
unbleached domestic was mixed with Japanese perfumes of
sandalwood and incense, and with the unique aroma of
hair-oil made from camellia berries. Work went on steadily.
Great white towers of bandages were finished, and removed
by servant-maids, who staggered, laughed, and joked softly,
as they bore the tottering burdens to the packing-room downstairs.
Sounds of hammer and nails arose as the packages
went into boxes. They could hear workmen haggling over
the spelling of certain Manchurian addresses.</p>

<p class="indent">In the big hall the nobly-born seamstresses talked, smiled,
raised eyebrows, nodded, shook their heads over bad news,
and gave small, half-finished exclamations over good, much
as a roomful of Western women might have done. The fortunes
of war dominated interest. Bereavement had already
fallen upon more than one of the gentle company. Death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
was spoken of quite simply, with no affectation of distress.
Universal contempt was expressed for a certain young widow
who had been coarse and self-centred enough to faint at her
husband&#39;s tomb. &quot;Hirotsunè&#39;s spirit must have covered his
eyes with shame at that sight, and thanked the gods she
had borne him no son,&quot; said an elderly aunt of the dead
hero, Hirotsunè.</p>

<p class="indent">But not all the conversation was of war. The rise in the
price of provisions was commented upon by anxious housewives.
In all cases the household expenses had been cut
down, and the money deflected to the national treasury.
This seemed as natural to them all as that water should
flow. &quot;The poor food makes, of course, no difference to
us who are adult, or to our boy children,&quot; murmured one
sweet-faced matron. &quot;But sometimes the babes, and the
very old servants, grumble a little at having barley mixed
with their rice.&quot; Fashions, since no one thought of buying
new gowns, was, for once in a female gathering, utterly
ignored. Gossip concerning foreign residents, especially
women, remained, as usual, an engrossing theme. The latest
Yokohama and Tsukijii scandals were whispered, not without
zest. These high-nosed, fierce-looking creatures of their
own sex were a source of constant marvelling to Japanese
women. &quot;Kitsui&quot; (mannish) they were called, as the extreme
of disapprobation. Yuki defended them, and gave a
softer coloring to some of the alleged misdeeds. Gwendolen
she cited as an example of a Western girl who must, in her
past incarnations, have been entirely Japanese. The guests
listened politely, but Yuki read skepticism on their calm
faces.</p>

<p class="indent">During the long forenoon not once was a voice raised or a
loud laugh heard. Yet not one face ever lapsed into indifference.
One might have gained from the resilient poise of
slender throats an impression of yielding strength. Their
chatter was a murmur, with tripping, short interludes of
sound, and cooing, long-drawn vowels soft as their own
white hands. They were a flock of gray doves in a sheltered
niche. Never, one would have said, were creatures more
tender, more feminine, more dependent. So would a foreigner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
have thought, to see them; but a Japanese knows
the truth. Not a woman there but might be the child, the
parent, the wife of a hero. Many had looked calmly on
death. Not one among them would falter at the extremest
test of heroic sacrifice, and should the call come, this little
sewing band would rise, arm itself with swords, and deal
what desperate death it could upon intruding enmity, before
at last plunging sharp surrender into its own brave heart.</p>

<p class="indent">At noon the Japanese meal was served. After it came a
little pause of rest, enlivened by smoking from small gold
pipes, and the drinking of added cups of tea. Just before
one o&#39;clock the sewing was resumed. Then the little silk-clad
ladies waited, in deeper agitation than they would have
felt in facing Kuropatkin, for the coming of their foreign
friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd was punctual almost to the minute. With her
came Gwendolen and Mrs. Stunt. A slight coolness now
existed between the two elder ladies. Mrs. Stunt&#39;s explanation
that her effusiveness to the Haganès was merely &quot;sarcasm&quot;
had failed to convince even so trustful a nature as
Mrs. Todd. Coolness, however, did not keep Mrs. Stunt from
a neighborhood where she might derive profit.</p>

<p class="indent">She had walked on foot to the Legation, declaring that her
jinrikisha-man was shockingly drunk, and had begged a seat
in the American carriage. It was, of course, given, and by
the time Yuki&#39;s residence was reached the artful one had regained
some of her lost favor with Mrs. Todd, and deepened
the loathing of the silent Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">The three came up the stairs together, their foreign shoes
pounding in unison, causing the huge, badly constructed house
to rattle at every window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Todd, as she lifted her lorgnette
to survey the long hall and the gathered company, &quot;a regular
sewing-bee, isn&#39;t it? And I see, Yuki, you&#39;ve got the piano
upstairs, after all. I didn&#39;t believe you&#39;d get it up those
steps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki had, of course, met them at the door. She and
Gwendolen fell, through force of habit, far in the wake of
the bustling dame. Mrs. Stunt kept well beside the leader.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
The two girls clasped hands shyly, and looked at each other
with side glances, like happy children in the first embarrassment
of play. Many of the Japanese ladies lifted glances of
interest to the tall blonde girl. This must be she of whom
the Princess Haganè had spoken, the girl with the face of
the Sun Goddess Amaterasu,&mdash;with the strayed soul of a
Nipponese. She wore this afternoon a simple costume of
golden-brown silk. It was just the transition tone between
her golden hair and the darker brows and lashes. A wide
hat of bronze-colored velvet piled high with paler plumes
balanced itself on her delicate head. Bronze-colored gloves
ran up the slender arms to the elbow, where the sleeves fell
away in a deep pointed ruff. A belt of dull yellow shark&#39;s
skin and bronze boots completed the costume. The seated
women, ignoring the advancing bulk of Madame Todd, the
restless insistency of her companion, let smiling eyes rest
on Gwendolen, then nodded to each other, and exchanged
glances, as if in corroboration of Yuki&#39;s previous words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am keeping seats for your party, dear Mrs. Todd, over
there by that most sunshine window,&quot; said Yuki. &quot;Please
see that a chair is held for Mrs. Wyndham, who is so very
kind to sing for us. Ah, I hear many peoples arriving. I
see Mrs. Wyndham now. I will advance to her.&quot; Yuki
hurried off, and soon returned with the prima donna, whom
she delivered into Mrs. Todd&#39;s efficient hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My <i>dear</i> Mrs. Wyndham,&quot; cried that lady. &quot;Oh, I beg
pardon. Mrs. Stunt, Mrs. Wyndham; my daughter, Miss
Todd, Mrs. Wyndham. I didn&#39;t realize that you had not
met Miss Todd.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I called at your Legation last Tuesday,&mdash;the proper day,
I am sure,&mdash;but failed to see Miss Todd,&quot; said the Englishwoman,
stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd flushed crimson. Mrs. Stunt turned away to
hide her satisfaction. A public slight to Gwendolen generally
meant, for Mrs. Todd, attempted annihilation of the
offender. She turned angered eyes to Mrs. Wyndham, and
would have spoken, but Gwendolen pressed her arm. &quot;No,
mother dear, don&#39;t defend me; I deserve it. Let me speak.
Mrs. Wyndham, I am mother&#39;s despair at the Legation. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
forget reception-days half the time. I&mdash;I&mdash;&quot; here she
lowered her voice to a delicious, confidential whisper, &quot;the
fact is I&mdash;I <i>shirk</i> them. So many old frumps, you know!
It&#39;s getting to be a regular hen-roost. But, honest, I am
sorry I was out last Tuesday, and I want you to give me
another chance.&quot; Gwendolen could generally be irresistible
when she chose. Now she chose not only to win Mrs.
Wyndham, to whose high-bred English face she had taken
an instant liking, but to deal another blow to her enemy
Mrs. Stunt.</p>

<p class="indent">In both efforts she was successful, though Mrs. Wyndham
did not capitulate all at once. The sparkling hazel eyes
and the gray ones met. Suspicion lived a little longer in
the latter. &quot;Please,&quot; murmured Gwendolen. Suspicion
died. &quot;I am always at home on my Wednesdays,&quot; said the
Englishwoman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be there,&quot; laughed Gwendolen. &quot;Have me a place
set at your breakfast-table!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki had vanished to perform her duties of hostess. Mrs.
Todd and her small party took the &quot;sunshine&quot; seats, and
a Japanese lady whom they had not met brought them foreign
sewing materials. Work had not begun with them
when a low, plaintive voice leaned to Mrs. Todd&#39;s large
ear. &quot;Please, please, help me in all ways you can, dear
Mrs. Todd. This is much worse than that reception I held
downstairs. So many foreign ladies are come,&mdash;and they
all look at everybody so very hard! Ask kind Mrs.
Wyndham to sing just as soon as she are ready, and soon,
please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Wyndham rose instantly, and looked with composure
over the sea of lifted heads. Every chair was now taken,
and servants brought up new ones from the rooms downstairs.
She was used to audiences, also to commendation.
In her hands she held a roll of music. Mrs. Wyndham was
one of those colonists&mdash;a large class in the Far East&mdash;who
never forgive Japan for not being England. She emphasized
her homesickness by withdrawal from all native
interests, except, as now, when she could give pleasure and
assistance by her voice. It was her pride that she ate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
no Japanese products. Everything on her table was &quot;imported.&quot;
Even her garden held only English flowers. That
great sea of spiritual and physical beauty which lies in Japanese
character, and in its environment, was to her nonexistent.
Such dwellers in the East are like children who,
in springtime, search the grass for fallen apples, and never
once lift their disappointed faces to the pink canopy of
bloom.</p>

<p class="indent">As may be inferred, all Japanese music was, to Mrs.
Wyndham and her intimate associates, mere squeaking,
caterwauling, an excruciating discord. She spoke constantly
of &quot;civilized&quot; music. She was fond of referring to the English
school of harmony. She was exaggerated in her use of
English method.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I be compelled to play my own accompaniment?&quot;
now asked Mrs. Wyndham. Her pretty face showed concern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If the music is not too hard I will try,&quot; said Gwendolen,
springing from her chair, while scissors and thimble fell clattering
to the floor. She gave the fallen articles a contemptuous
glance, and, without a motion to rescue them, followed
Mrs. Wyndham to the piano.</p>

<p class="indent">A group of young Japanese girls, put in a corner to themselves,
exchanged looks of delight, and began to titter like
wrens. &quot;How much do the ways of the honorable foreign
scissors and thimble resemble those of Japanese scissors and
thimble!&quot; they confided one to another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My thimble generally rolls off the veranda and buries
itself among pebbles. I think it possesses an imp!&quot; laughed
one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mine goes always into the red coals of the hibachi,&quot;
giggled another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is precisely the conduct of my worthless article,&quot;
added a third. &quot;The water-kettle has to be taken aside,
and grandmother scowls. Then we all dig for the thimble
with the copper fire-sticks. When we find it, it is quite
black, and&mdash;Ma-a-a!&mdash;so hot, that it must be dropped at
once into cold water, where it hisses like the head of a small
serpent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now what shall I sing for such a crowd as this?&quot; mused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
Mrs. Wyndham, as she shuffled the loose leaves of her music.
Her words had the sound of inner meditation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would the Japanese like best?&quot; asked Gwendolen,
in a low tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my <i>dear</i>! I wasn&#39;t thinking of them!&quot; protested
the other. &quot;They are incapable of appreciating any real
music. I was thinking of our foreign friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki Haganè is a Japanese. She loves the best music.
Brahms is almost a passion with her. She says that he
sounds like the wind in pine-trees, high above a great
battle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Brahms!&quot; said the other. &quot;I never sing Brahms.
He is too harsh and unpoetic. These bellowing contraltos
affect him. As for me, I must have something light, poetic,
full of melody.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here is our American McDowell,&quot; murmured Gwendolen,
and bent her face that its expression might not be seen.
&quot;Being patriotic by profession I plead for McDowell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do not consider him,&mdash;over their heads?&quot; asked
the Englishwoman, dubiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well, you can give them Sullivan next time, and
bring down the average!&quot; Mrs. Wyndham bent a suspicious
look, but Gwendolen&#39;s lifted gaze was that of a
seraph over a last harp note. &quot;I&#39;ll try McDowell. Can
you play the accompaniment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can at least attempt it,&quot; said Gwendolen, meekly, and
forthwith rippled out the prelude with an ease that further
deepened suspicion.</p>

<p class="indent">The song began with a single note, long sustained, the
voice striking in abruptly among hurrying chords. Mrs.
Wyndham&#39;s beautiful voice took it like a star. Suddenly,
with another upward swerve, the note wavered, passed into
a new kindling as into the life of a bird, and swept along on
higher currents with motionless, outspread wings.</p>

<p class="indent">The foreign ladies exchanged glances of rapture. The
Japanese workers, on the other hand, stared first in astonishment,
then with growing apprehension. Surely this was
not singing! Something must be going wrong with the
honorable insides of the kind lady! They stole timid looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
toward their hostess, and by her calm, interested face were
reassured. Still the piercing note went higher. The singer&#39;s
throat swelled slightly, and her face turned red. From the
group of Japanese girls one hysterical chuckle escaped. That
set off the whole lot. Staid matrons bowed convulsed faces
to folds of cotton cloth; silken sleeves came into requisition.
A few of the foreign ladies looked about and frowned. Yuki
half rose from her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, fortunately, the highest note was reached. It broke
its flight with a great twitter of wings. The bars of a
staccato love-song began. Again the Japanese women stared,
but now in admiration as well as wonder. Never were singing
notes so light, so delicate, so silvery! As the song ended
(and indeed it had been exquisitely given), the foreign ladies
burst into simultaneous applause. Led by the bolder among
them, the Japanese followed suit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, we can&#39;t let you stop at <i>that</i>, dear Mrs. Wyndham,&quot;
came Mrs. Stunt&#39;s high, rasping voice. &quot;Won&#39;t you give us
that lovely thing of Goo-nowd&#39;s you sung at our last Charity
concert?&quot; Mrs. Wyndham consented. After Gounod it was
an English ballad, then another and another, until at length
the singer, with pretty petulance, turned from the piano saying
that she had already monopolized too much time. A great
buzzing of thanks and congratulations surged about her. No
expression of admiration was too exaggerated. In fact there
was none that pretty Mrs. Wyndham had not heard many
times before. She accepted these tributes now, as usual, with
deprecating smiles, and little protesting shakes of the head,
finally declaring that they would make her conceited if they
didn&#39;t stop.</p>

<p class="indent">No one noticed the American girl, still at the piano. She
gave a swift look around, and seeing that the biwa player
had not come, began whispering to the keys the first notes
of one of Chopin&#39;s most delicate fantasies. Like the down
on a moth&#39;s wing, it came. Like crystal raindrops, then,
mixed with the perfume of bruised petals, and sometimes
the distant yearning of a bird. This was music that even
the untutored Japanese girls could feel. It held the sound
of their own koto strings,&mdash;it breathed whispers of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
own trees, and winds, and sighing sea-stretches. Gradually
all voices in the room ceased. Faster the notes came, though
still with a suggestion of whispering. Gwendolen&#39;s white
hands became a misty blur. The theme drew closer, with
now a wind-driven swish of rain and scurrying petals; now
the nearer cry of a bird, and a low under-rhythm of human
sorrow. The sounds whirled and lifted into melodious agitation.
The caged bird seemed to give low plaints of fear;
the wind and the rain drove close, dashed into the face of
silence, and drew back. Then all sounds died away in waves
of exhausted sobbing. Gwendolen sprang up, leaving the
piano vibrant. She hurried to the nearest window, turning
her face from all in the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Wyndham was the first to speak. Her light laugh
had an artificial sound. &quot;And to think, my dear, that I
insisted upon knowing whether you could manage my
accompaniments!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen did not heed. She was tingling with the excitement
and unrest that Chopin&#39;s music so often brought
her. Yuki came softly, slipping a little scarred hand into
that of her friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hate Chopin!&quot; cried the American girl, in a low,
angry voice. &quot;I wonder why I keep on playing him!
Every time I say I won&#39;t, and then I go and do it! He is
morbid, he is childish, he is French! One sees his weak
chin quiver, and the tears roll down his cheek! He wants
you to see them. I hate him, I say! But, oh, he is a
compelling genius!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he do like every one to see him when he cries. But
when I hear him I think, &#39;Oh, what must it be to a person&#39;s
soul to be able to cry such tears of music!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A sound at the main entrance-door caused the little hostess
to turn. &quot;Ah, there is the Satsuma biwa player! I must
now go to him. He, too, makes tears, Gwendolen, but of a
different sort. Perhaps you will not wish to cry for him.
You may even think him to be funny, as many of the Japanese
ladies thought Mrs. Wyndham&#39;s beautiful singing to
be funny. You must not try to stay,&mdash;you and Mrs. Todd,&mdash;if
it will tire you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
As she hurried away Mrs. Wyndham drew slowly near.
&quot;You naughty one! I shall owe you a grudge for this.
You are not to be forgiven until you promise to come
often&mdash;often&mdash;and let us play sometimes together. You
are a genius!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not quite that, I think,&quot; said Gwendolen, smiling.
&quot;Though, indeed, I have never known a friend to take
music&#39;s place, except Yuki; and now that she is a princess,
I suppose I can&#39;t feel her to be so much my own. I
shall love to come to you and play. Your voice is like sunshine
on an English fountain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said the other, &quot;what a charming speech! No
man could say anything half so pretty! Now, as reward, I
am going to give you a piece of valuable advice.&quot; She leaned
confidentially near. &quot;Make your escape while you can.&quot;
She nodded significantly toward the biwa player, who, with
Yuki beside him, stood shrinkingly in the doorway. &quot;I&#39;ve
heard him once,&mdash;or one like him. It is what you Americans
might call &#39;the limit&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean for me to go? But I have never heard any
Japanese music at all!&quot; protested Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, in that case&mdash;&quot; said Mrs. Wyndham, with her delicate
shrug. &quot;If you care for the experience!&quot; She hurried
off with many protestations of regret. Several other ladies
followed her example.</p>

<p class="indent">The biwa player now stood beside the piano. Two Japanese
tatami (padded straw mats six feet in length) were
brought in and placed upon the floor. Before inviting him
to be seated Yuki made a hesitating little speech to the company,
first in English, then in Japanese, saying to the foreigners
that while the music to come would doubtless be
strange, and possibly displeasing to them, to her and her
compatriots it was a trumpet-call to heroism. &quot;It stirs our
blood to every drop!&quot; she cried, forgetting, for the instant,
her shyness. &quot;It echoes to the brave deeds of a thousand
years ago,&mdash;it foretells deeds more greater that may come!
It is the crying of strong souls, it is breath of our fathers&#39;
Gods!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen, in that vague sort of way in which impressions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
of alien customs are formed, had believed all male musicians
in Japan to be blind. Some one had told her so, or she had
read it. She was surprised, therefore, and interested, to see
in this famous singer of battle-hymns a young man, indeed
almost a boy, with thin, shaven face, tumultuous black hair
not too closely or evenly cut, tossed in thick locks all over
his well-poised head; and eyes, large, straight, expressive, and
brilliant enough to be the ornament of a young French or
Italian seigneur. He showed a slight embarrassment, at
first, in the presence of so many women. He was used to
the audience of statesmen, to the flashing response of
Majesty. Here were not only Japanese girls, mere children,
but a great company of high-nosed, pink and purple
foreigners. Saturated as he was, made up of lore and
legend, with songs of the Lady Sakanouyè, or of Ono no
Komachi never far from his lips, even Gwendolen&#39;s bright
beauty seemed a trifle abnormal, bleached, repellent.</p>

<p class="indent">Now his hostess, the young Princess Haganè, looked into
his eyes, and spoke to him in their own tongue. &quot;Be not
concerned, honorable sir, at the presence of foreign women!
They cannot understand your words, of course; but I am
sure they will listen courteously. As for us,&mdash;we Japanese
women,&mdash;we are the wives, the daughters, the mothers of
heroes. Our frail lives toss as thin flames on the altar of
prayer. We cannot fight, we can only pray and work. Sing
strength to us as we minister to distant soldiers dying, perhaps
on barren fields, or heaped, dead, in the ploughed siege-trenches
of this fearful war!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His deep eyes seemed to drink of her inspiration, so long
was the gaze with which he held her. &quot;I am honored to sing
at your bidding,&quot; he answered. He had forgotten to bow at
the words. He forgot that she was a princess. He recognized
her as a spirit. Forever after this slight girl, seen
but once, became one of the poet&#39;s galaxy of pale, pure stars.
For years he could not sing of the death-struggle of the Heikè
clan without a vision of her prophetic eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">He took his seat very slowly on the soft straw mat. Yuki
withdrew, and became lost among her guests. The biwa, a
large lute in the shape of half a pear, had been held, all this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
time, closely against the young man&#39;s breast. Now, in taking
his seat, the instrument was extended to the full length of
his right arm. It gave out, under his close grasp, a sleepy
hum. For an instant only it was placed apart from him, on
the mat, that he might spread and smooth the knees of his
silken robe, draw his stiff sleeves into exact angles, and
adjust the low kimono collar. Then he turned impatiently
again to the lute. It murmured to him; he drew it close,
smiling as a mother upon her babe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ain&#39;t he handsome for a Jap?&quot; whispered Mrs. Stunt
to Gwendolen. The girl winced. She was studying him in
her own way. His manner, just before beginning, was aloof
and reserved, as if he were restating to himself consecration
to service. The Japanese women, even the oldest, gazed
upon him with deep reverence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beethoven may have smiled like that, or St. Francis of
Assisi,&quot; thought Gwendolen. &quot;It is a look, not of race,
but of immortality.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The player&#39;s head lifted slightly. He was losing consciousness
of material presences. His part was with the
unseen world; he must draw down currents of a mighty
past, and send them as new streams of influence, on through
a menaced future. For he was to improvise, not to repeat.
His theme alone was set,&mdash;a most heroic incident of civil
wars, resulting in extermination of a dominating clan. The
annihilation of the Heikè might give him text, but the flow
of rhythmic words should vibrate, thrill, moan, quicken,
purl, or shatter, as the mood of the moment might demand.
Doubtless in this pause he was invoking, in full faith, the
souls of those dead heroes; offering them possession of his
human frame, and entreating higher gods to make him
worthy of the test.</p>

<p class="indent">His low voice and the first three slow notes rose together.
The minor quality suggested lamentation. A short passage,
rapidly chanted without accompaniment, made the hearts of
the listeners beat a little faster. Then voice and instrument
clashed together; both whirled nearer, until, all at once,&mdash;silence!
The player looked about the room in bewilderment.
He stared down upon the biwa. He closed his eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
and swayed slightly backward, then forward, then back again.
Suddenly he reopened his eyes. They were larger, more
brilliant; they flashed a new fire, the glare of battle reflected
in their depths. Words now came rapidly. His sentences
fell of themselves into long, unstable rhythms. Cadences
were lacking. All phrasing, except in rarest intervals,
broke into the air with a sob, a sigh, a shuddering gasp.
Often now the biwa strings were slashed across by the ivory
plectrum, and the human wail rang through vibrating response.
Then voice and strings plunged into a seeming discord,
a frantic wrack of sound exorcised an instant later by
pure calm notes struck separately, like the drip of slow water.</p>

<p class="indent">In the sense of Western harmony there was none, but something
in the weird vibrations of long notes, the intricacies
of overtone, and, above all, the unbelievable subtleties of
rhythm, gave to one eager American listener, at least, her
first insight into a new world of sound. &quot;They are nearer
in this, as in all their other arts, to nature,&quot; she thought to
herself. &quot;They summon the very essences of being, and find
skeins for entangling them. Without conscious representation,
they suggest to the human ear the lisp of sea winds,
the flutter of fire, the rushing monologue of mountain streams.
They hear sounds we Westerners never hear. I believe the
very mists are audible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the emotion increased and the subject became more
martial, the time of the music grew rapid, broken, syncopated,
involved. Soft, melodious passages shattered into
jarring notes. Like European troubadours of France, or
the meistersingers of mediæval Germany, he yielded himself
to the unconscious swing of impulse, and sang what was
given him. Lines shortened. Syllables became more staccato.
It was dramatic, undidactic&mdash;the deeds rather than
the thoughts of men. His diction became more simple and
direct, with sharp, incisive verbs at the end that rang like
smitten steel. His whole body, at times, was shaken. After
some terrific passage, while the sobbing lute-strings sustained
the passion, his body would bend over and down, as if, in
its abandonment to joy, grief, or battle ardor, it would hug
the instrument that had become its soul.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
Now he sang of the hero youth, Atsumori, of his insistence
upon honorable death at the hand of his conqueror,
Kumagayè.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;The Hour of the Hare comes at last, and the red sun advances,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Raised like a cry and a shield in the mists of the morning,</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Warriors and chiefs and the dauntless brave youth Atsumori</span><br />
<span class="i0">Drive to the sea all the hordes of the sweating red demons.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The dove-gray garments of the Japanese women, folded
so modestly across seemingly quiet breasts, began to stir
and palpitate. More than one tear fell upon the bandages.
Yuki&#39;s face, set now unfalteringly upon the singer, grew
ever more white; her long eyes burned, and trembled apart.
Unconsciously she went close to him, and, kneeling upon
the hard floor, drank of his voice. The group of Japanese
maidens hid faces in their bright sleeves. The air stirred
and tingled with invisible influences. Gwendolen began to
shiver like an animal which knows not its own source of
fear. The charged atmosphere, the face, the voice of the
singer, Yuki&#39;s great glowing eyes, swept in her soul strained
chords of unknown feeling. She felt in herself the vibrations
of that trembling lute. In its cell a soul, just wakened,
fumbled at a new discovered latch. &quot;Surely it must be reincarnation,&quot;
whispered the girl. &quot;Surely I have felt and
seen all this before! Yuki and I together have listened;
that look was on her face. Yuki!&quot; The cry was scarcely
a whisper. Yuki, many feet away, could not possibly have
heard, yet instantly she turned,&mdash;the eyes, night-black and
hazel, caught and clung together, with half ghostly memories
that were the same.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Hissed there the sea with the scorching of steel and of passion,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rolled up the clouds from the sky and the shore in a tumult,</span><br />
<span class="i0">There on the sand lies the body of young Atsumori.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">One great crashing across the strings, &quot;like the tearing of
brocade,&quot; and the singer&#39;s head fell forward,&mdash;his frame
trembled and shrank, he quivered into stillness. Yuki half
crawled to him, holding out a protecting arm, and facing her
guests like a young tigress. &quot;Do not any one speak. Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
not crowd about him,&quot; she cried in English. &quot;His soul will
be weary from the long journey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese women understood, and returned quietly
to their sewing. The foreigners tittered, shrugged, and exchanged
glances, then they, too, began to work. A servant
brought tea to the singer, and a glass of cold water. At
length he stretched out a trembling hand to the latter, and
having finished the draught, rose quietly and went from
the room, with Yuki close behind. A few moments later
Gwendolen heard her returning, unaccompanied, along the
hall. She went out to meet her, thankful indeed for the
privilege of a few words alone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki-ko,&quot; she faltered, &quot;I just wanted to say that at last
I understand,&mdash;I think I understand entirely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, still half in the world of shadows, gave her a
strange look. &quot;You understand, Gwendolen? Is it my
marriage you speak of?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, so much more than that!&quot; cried the other, with a
little sob. &quot;Had you been what the conventional foreigner
calls &#39;faithful,&#39; you would have been the most faithless girl
in all the world!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a wonderful friend,&quot; said Yuki. Her voice had
the strange quality of her look. Both had caught the rhythm
of low martial chanting. &quot;But even you, my Gwendolen,
did not hear or understand it all. There is tragedy before
me. You did not hear that in the music?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I heard it, darling, but I shut my ears! I
shall not believe. We can compel even tragedy, Yuki.
Nothing can harm you with Haganè&#39;s love!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is of that the tragedy come. But do not trouble. If
I can serve Nippon, I asks no more of this life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki, what can you mean?&quot; cried the other, holding
her back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, dearest; do not trouble,&quot; smiled Yuki. &quot;See, the
guests turn their heads to listen. I must go to them. I
have no fear at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Throughout</span> the months of March and early April this
strange hiatus in war bulletins hung, like a gray sky, above
national enthusiasm. The more dignified of the newspapers
still adjured the populace to patience, still exhorted them to
have faith in their wise and careful leaders. &quot;The Hawk&#39;s
Eye,&quot; on the other hand, bereft of inflammatory battle themes,
served up, with new condiment of ingenious suggestion, the
personal gossip of the hour. Few of the weekly issues (those
printed entirely in English) omitted a guarded slur upon the
conjugal felicity of the Haganè household. Gwendolen came
in for her share of veiled allusion. Yuki-ko, each week stung
by the contemptible malice of the attack, promised herself
that never again should the paper be opened in her home.
Gwendolen, at the American Legation, weekly did the same.
The results of both resolutions were equally humiliating.</p>

<p class="indent">This was not a happy time for Gwendolen, creature of
sunshine and spring breezes as she seemed. The continued
strained relations between herself and Dodge interfered quite
seriously at times with the young man&#39;s official duties. Mr.
Todd leaned more heavily than he knew upon his attaché&#39;s
four past years of experience in Tokio life, and resented an
attitude of one of his own family, which kept Dodge so rigidly
within the paling of mere officialdom. Mrs. Todd, who had
never professed great friendship for the secretary, now most
loudly denounced his &quot;outrageous flirtation&quot; with the Spanish
girl, and even declared it an affront upon her Legation. Gwendolen,
urged one moment to stop the affair, &quot;as she certainly
could by the lifting of a finger,&quot; was, the instant after, taunted
by her inability to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">The public friendship between Dodge and the charming
Señorita deepened obviously with each day. Hints of an
early marriage flecked &quot;The Hawk&#39;s Eye.&quot; Mrs. Todd began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
to feel herself personally injured by her wilful daughter.
Finally, goaded into action and spurred by her own restless
heart, the girl made a counter-move of a sudden and desperate
intimacy with Carmen herself. Such things are not unknown
in the history of adolescence. Carmen yielded to the American&#39;s
bright fascination with the caressing languor characteristic
of her. The two girls lunched together, dined, drove, and
had tea together, and spoke of each other in exaggerated terms
of endearment. Dodge, whatever his private surmises, retained
an unaltered front. Naturally he and Gwendolen were more
often together. She showed to him an air of cherished hostility,
varied by small lightning-flashes of appeal. Two feminine
currents blew full upon him. Dodge kept his hat on.
The beautiful Castilian bore toward him the attitude of an
indulgent conqueror. Gwendolen aided this, and whenever
possible threw Dodge into the position of Carmen&#39;s accepted
lover. Also, for some reason known only to herself, she encouraged
the Spanish girl in her belief in Dodge&#39;s overwhelming
adoration.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen soon discovered that her new friend had an uncontrollable
yearning for &quot;dulces,&quot; and eagerly embraced this
opportunity for demonstrating her new affection. Gwendolen
scoured the alleys of old Yedo for novel sweetmeats; she
purveyed from the French shops of Yokohama imported dainties;
she sent a telegraphic order to a certain New York confectioner.
Carmen appreciated and devoured all results. The
Japanese confections, which many other European ladies might
(without, of course, having tasted) pretend to despise, she
declared delicious. The &quot;ama-natto,&quot; or small purple bean,
boiled and sugar-coated with lilac frosting, she called &quot;fairy
marron.&quot; Mikan, or small oranges preserved whole, with a
flake of cinnamon and ginger, gained an established place on
the Spanish Legation table. &quot;Hakka ame,&quot; that delicious triangle
of peppermint cream, improved from an American missionary&#39;s
original recipe, vied in public favor, as a hors-d&#39;&oelig;uvre
with French bonbons, salted almonds, and olives.</p>

<p class="indent">Once Carmen&#39;s French maid, suspecting, perhaps, more than
a purely altruistic intention in Gwendolen&#39;s persistent offerings,
warned her young mistress against immoderate indulgence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
in sweet foods, and protested, with many gesticulations
and a hint of tears, that the very last importation of Paris
gowns already needed the letting out of seams, and would
soon be unwearable. &quot;Nonsense, Lizette,&quot; smiled the pampered
one, &quot;not eat dulces? I have always eaten dulces.
How, in the Virgin&#39;s name, would one get through a novel
without a plate of dulces beside it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The maid sent a hostile glance to Gwendolen, which the
blonde beauty had the conscience not to resent. Rapidly increasing
embonpoint was Carmen&#39;s one menace to beauty. She
had already begun to pray to her patron saint for diminution.
On the prie-dieu invariably lay a half-nibbled chocolate. Were
not Gwendolen&#39;s friendship so open, so obvious, one might
have suspected that she connived with fate to circumvent her
Carmen&#39;s petition; that actually she assisted in the mournful
process of burying perfect features and luscious, languorous
dark eyes in warm cushions of pink fat. But no, we must not
think such things of Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">Because of the new intimacy and an increasing activity in
Tokio society Gwendolen now saw much less of her schoolmate,
Yuki. Perhaps it was as well. The Princess Haganè had
her own lessons to learn, and they were Japanese lessons.
Following close upon her first sewing-meeting came Yuki&#39;s
presentation to Their Majesties. The court ladies welcomed
her into their midst. As in humbler Japanese circles she
was immediately asked innumerable questions. In return
she began learning, from her high-born interrogants, the new
language of extreme court ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent">Another reception and another sewing-meeting fell due. To
the latter of these functions a mere handful of foreign ladies
came. Gwendolen and Mrs. Todd were detained, actually, by
some globe-trotting Washington associates, who landed that
very day at Yokohama. In the two subsequent gatherings
foreign attendance ceased altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">Each reception was, however, a &quot;crush.&quot; Gossip is a magnet;
the presence of eligible young men not exactly detraction.
Mrs. Stunt and others of her kind went openly to see
whether Pierre Le Beau would attend, and how he would conduct
himself before host and hostess. It was the secret craving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
of such social vultures that a scene, the more disgraceful the
better, be enacted for their entertainment, and the disappointment
was correspondingly keen when neither Pierre nor Count
Ronsard attended. The count, indeed, sent cards and a gift of
flowers. No mention at all was made of the younger man.</p>

<p class="indent">Three of the Haganè official functions had taken place.
March hurled itself gruffly into the outstretched arms of
spring. Gwendolen knew why Pierre stayed away and why
Ronsard remained so impassive. She had good reasons for
not telling Yuki. At her friend&#39;s silence the latter wondered.
Instinct told her that there was a deeper explanation than
mere forgetfulness. More than once she had nerved herself
to inquire; but always, just on the point of asking, something
had happened to interfere.</p>

<p class="indent">A new cry, which affected Yuki far more openly, began to
ring through the current press. &quot;If complications have arisen
in Manchuria let Prince Haganè go and unravel them!&quot; This
demand grew in insistence with each day. Presently the whole
nation had arisen, and was clamoring, &quot;Send our War Lord,
Haganè, to the front!&quot; Yuki waited patiently for her husband
to inform her of the reception of this demand in high
quarters. Like a good Japanese wife she dared not force the
issue. On every side her part, it seemed, was to wait, to command
herself, to endure suspense. To an impatient nature
such as Gwendolen this would have been torture. To Yuki,
trained through centuries of brave ancestors to play her
woman&#39;s part of uncomplaining quiescence, the strain was not
so great. Her ignorance of Pierre seemed, indeed, the heaviest
burden. She scanned now the English columns of every
paper, hoping against hope that her eyes would seize the
printed assurance of his return to France. This was the young
wife&#39;s prayer, uttered on her knees each night, muttered
through pale lips a hundred times each day, that Pierre would
go quietly home, and in his own dear land forget the woman
who had broken faith with him. His threat against Haganè&#39;s
life did not sound to her absurd. It re-echoed to her, always
with a pang of fear. Love and hate alike give preternatural
insight. By injury to Prince Haganè alone could Pierre gain
full revenge. By this means he could strip the flesh from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
bones of her loyal sacrifice, laying bare the grinning skeleton
of a national disaster, wreaked through her.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course she could not speak these fears to Haganè. There
was no one, not even Gwendolen, to whom she could whisper
them. Haganè was now seldom at his home. She gathered,
once or twice, from gossip of the servants, that he had spent
the previous night and day at the Tabata villa, with a small
company of statesmen as his guests. In the infrequent visits,
she, studying his face with unconscious intensity, saw the
same power, the same sadness, the invincible strength unshadowed
and unexcited by this renewal of popular hero-worship.
The thought that he might leave her alone, to fulfil
the duties of his position, brought to the young wife a pang of
terror, of misgiving. She believed it to be merely a shrinking
from heavy responsibility. To outward appearance she and
Haganè stood on opposite shores of an increasing chasm; but
in her heart, when she dared listen to its timid pleadings, she
knew it to be a narrowing, not a widening, void their joint
lives spanned. She could not doubt that he felt some grave
pleasure in seeing her on his expected visits to the great shell
of his official home. The weekly receptions, where she bore
herself with ever-increasing dignity and poise, did indeed give
to the husband a deep impersonal satisfaction. It was more
than satisfaction that he felt, as he saw the great filled packing-cases
sent away each week to suffering soldiers in Manchuria.</p>

<p class="indent">Once, coming in upon her unannounced, as was his custom,
he had suddenly taken the white thing in his arms, thrown
her head back to his shoulder, and gazed into her eyes as
though to drag from some hidden depth an awakening thought,&mdash;a
cradled possibility. Yuki&#39;s lids drooped under the blinding
force of his look. She felt as though a great silent wind
blew, pinning her against a rock. Surely in his twitching face
was more than a calm self-congratulation! It was the man,
the master, summoning by right what was rightly his. Love&mdash;strong,
terrible, yet tender, showed for an instant in his
dark eyes. He went from her as quickly as he had come.
No word had broken the silence. During the rest of that
day Yuki rocked in her heart a new-born hope, a possibility
so strange, so ineffable that she dared not open her eyes to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
tiny face. With bowed head and fast-closed lids she hushed
it. That day set her feet on the temple-stair of shining
prophecy. But how dare she, already to one pledge so faithless,
climb upward, even on bleeding knees, to that splendid
portico above?</p>

<p class="indent">April spread her witchery of green and flowers over a
thousand barren hills. Wild azaleas, wigelia, and bokè (pyrus
Japonica) barred the slopes with pink and crimson radiance.
Valleys, so lately brown, spread now a wide bloom of violets,
a curdled residue of purple morning mists. Earth-dwarfs,
congeners of Loki, who people the under-world, drove upward
from their subterranean caves huge copper spikes of young
bamboo&mdash;ten inches across, some of it, as it pierced the
mould&mdash;a marvellous springing column climbing by joints,
two feet a day, toward the sun, and casting off brown sheaths,
like outgrown jackets. Children roamed the hedges, the rice-field
dykes, and copses (forgotten and unbuilded, sometimes
in the very heart of Yedo) for tsukushimbo and the yellow
chrysanthemum. All gardens, even those amorphous products
of Eurasian uncertainty surrounding the American Legation
and Yuki&#39;s official home, needed to be fair. Birds came to
them, and early butterflies. The sun poured down upon them
in equal measure his golden cataracts of joy.</p>

<p class="indent">Saturday of the first week came. Pierre Le Beau had not
been mentioned to the Princess Haganè, nor had she found
a printed notice of him containing a hint of information.
Cleverly insulated wires of venom, it is true, attached to her
name and Haganè&#39;s. Sometimes Pierre was subtly referred
to, but never openly. Next day, thought Yuki, she would
go to church. Perhaps something would be said of him by
the ladies who always crowded so eagerly about her carriage
door. This weekly service, in the Episcopal church at
Tsukijii, formed now the closest tie that bound Yuki to her
Western memories. It was anticipated with eagerness. This
link, at least, she told herself should not be snapped.
Haganè&#39;s consent that she continue openly her Christian
devotions had been unqualified.</p>

<p class="indent">The mail that Saturday morning proved unusually large.
An American mail-ship was in. Several letters and papers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
came from trans-Pacific friends, a great many Tokio social
invitations, a few notes relating to Red Cross matters, and
one folded pamphlet with a Japanese postmark. She knew
from its pink wrapping that it was &quot;The Weekly Hawk&#39;s
Eye.&quot; With a slight shudder she put the evil thing aside,
with a vague reawakening of the intention to burn it unopened.
Slowly she read her letters and invitations. She glanced
through the few American papers for any blue markings.
All were finished. She leaned to gather them up and have
them taken to her private desk upstairs, when the sun,
pointing one bright finger through a blind, fell upon the pink
wrapper and rested on her name. &quot;Princess Sanètomo
Haganè.&quot; It looked very cheerful and suggestive. The dull
pink of the cheap paper glowed into a rosy hue. Perhaps
it was an omen. Perhaps if she were brave and opened the
sheet boldly she would find, instead of the usual malicious
innuendoes, the announcement that Pierre was leaving for
France. Thinking of Haganè&#39;s eyes as they had probed her
own she flushed, trembled a little, and murmured aloud,
&quot;Oh, if he would only go&mdash;if Pierre would only go&mdash;how
happy&mdash;&quot; She broke off. A wave of compunction, pity
for Pierre, scorn of her own fickleness, rushed upon her.
She took the paper hastily, set her lips for what might be
in store, and opened at random.</p>

<p class="indent">Her name was plain enough, and Prince Haganè&#39;s. This
time headlines had been dared. &quot;Prince Haganè soon to
leave his young wife. The Nation demands his presence at
the centre of martial differences. Haganè loath to leave his
young wife. Who knows what may happen? M. Le Beau
raving in delirium at the German hospital in Yokohama.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So much she read and paused. Very quietly she folded
the paper and slipped it within a gray silk sleeve. She
stooped for the crumpled pink wrapping, smoothed it also,
and dropped it in her sleeve. Next she gathered into a neat
package the mail she had been reading, rang for a maid-servant,
and sent the mail up to her boudoir. Her orders were
given in the usual low, pleasant voice. In closing, she said,
&quot;Should visitors come I am to be found in this room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again alone, she walked to a western window and stared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
out at the great square shadow of the house thrown across the
awkward garden. Beyond the straight line of the shadow,
paths shone brilliantly in the sun, and flowers danced. Spring
had come a little early. Everything that had a blossom to
show rushed, it would seem, to the perfumed exhibition.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki shivered slightly. For the first time she knew that
her hands were growing cold. She moved slowly toward the
fireplace, an ordinary foreign grate with coal fire burning.
Nearer the warmth she drew out again the pamphlet,
unfolded and deliberately read the article from the first word
to the last. Some passages she dwelt upon, extracting to its
full flavor the bitterness of frustrated hope.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the &quot;Hawk&#39;s Eye&quot; correspondent, Pierre had
caught germs of malignant malaria, perhaps of typhus, while
wandering in a state of great mental agony along the moats
that border a certain official dwelling. He was now at the
crisis of his malady. Two nurses watched him night and
day, for his dementia had made of him a cunning schemer,
full of sly efforts to escape. When detained he raved fearfully,
saying that he had &quot;things to do.&quot; &quot;The Hawk&#39;s Eye&quot;
ingenuously marvelled as to what these &quot;things&quot; could possibly
be. As is usual with articles so inspired the suggestions were
far more damaging than any actual statement.</p>

<p class="indent">She let her hands fall limp. One still clasped the ugly
journal. Only a few moments before she had accused herself
of heartlessness toward one she had wronged. In her
generosity she had almost demanded a deeper suffering, if
only it could be directed personally to her offending self, and
not include, in its consequences, that great man whose name
she now bore. Well, here was her punishment,&mdash;a fetid,
scalding stream of venom, hurled full and straight at her.
Attacks like this were, she knew, less to Haganè than the
mud children throw against the base of a lofty statue. His
mind moved in a stratum far above such contamination. The
nation spoke direct to him. His ear was for his Emperor, the
old gods of his race. &quot;Yes,&quot; thought the young wife, &quot;I
wished to suffer for the wrong I have done, but these writhings
of a polluted personality can scarcely be dignified by the
name of suffering. It is as if one went forth bravely to combat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
a knight in armor and encountered a filthy swine. One
cannot retaliate upon a beast. Nor,&quot;&mdash;here, with a nervous
transition to energy, she tore out the offending page,&mdash;&quot;nor
can I, being his wife, attempt punishment for this defilement.&quot;
The sound of tearing paper soothed her. One by one
she snatched the sheets, crumpling them loosely, and threw
each in turn upon the coals, where it twisted, opened its
angles, caught in a little puff of smoke, and burned quickly.
A sound came to the front door. Some one opened it. She
gathered the remaining pages, rolled them hastily into a pithy
sphere, and tossed the whole mass to the grate. A soft explosion
of smoke and brightness followed. Red light fawned
upward to the slender gray figure and excited face. A door
of the drawing-room opened, and the draught pulled out from
the grate before her a long, pliant tongue of flame. She felt
Haganè catch her backward. &quot;That is a risk, to burn papers
in these great, ill-constructed chimneys, my little one,&quot; he
said. Yuki clung to him, staring up into his face to try to
judge whether he had already seen the offensive article. He
had an unusual animation. She even fancied that his voice
shook; but it was not the excitement of anger or disgust.
Some national crisis had come. His next words proved the
truth of this supposition. &quot;I wish you not cremated this day
of all days,&quot; he smiled, trying, as she could see, to speak with
some lightness. &quot;I need my wife. An opportunity for service
has come, more important than all that has gone before.
Are you ready, my Princess?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord, I live but to serve you and my land.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are in a national crisis, Yuki,&quot; said her husband. He
began to walk up and down the long room with an abandonment
to agitation which she had not seen in him before. &quot;A
crisis,&quot; he repeated. &quot;I shall not explain the matter of it.
You need not have the weight and burden of such knowledge,
but you can aid me greatly.&quot; He paused now near a window.
Yuki followed. &quot;I await your pleasure, Lord,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to her the deep magnetic gaze she dreaded, yet,
strangely enough, longed, at times, to provoke. One massive
hand leaned on her shoulder. She had no impulse now to
shrink from him. She longed to cower against the strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
defence of him, to hide in his breast, in his sleeves, as the
frightened souls of little dead children hide in the sleeves of
Jizo Sama. As though understanding the unspoken longing
he drew her very near. His words were still impersonal.
&quot;Some terrible, hidden things long suspected have come to
light. I do not believe the wrong past mending. The first
step in restitution comes to-day. It is a secret meeting here,
in this house,&mdash;a small gathering of statesmen, but it may
mean to us defeat or victory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Lord, I listen. A meeting at this house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must appear to be a casual assembling. No servant, not
even the good Tora, is to be trusted. When I have given
you full instructions I return at once to the palace. Should
any unforeseen chance call me back before the hour of one, I
charge you speak no words into my ear, nor seek to deflect my
thoughts from their ominous course. I bear a heavy burden,
Yuki. But the Gods will aid me in my strength.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not honorably accost or fret you, Lord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The statesmen,&mdash;and here are the written initials of their
names,&quot;&mdash;he drew a small scrap of paper from his sleeve&mdash;&quot;these
seven statesmen, including Sir Charles Grubb and Mr.
Todd, will be ushered as usual into these drawing-rooms. If
no other guests be present, say to these men in turn, after the
first salutations, these exact words: &#39;I have received from my
lord instructions and the initials of your name.&#39; Can you
repeat precisely?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki did so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is well. Thirteen words, remember. They make to
these seven a sort of password. Each, as you speak, is to be
conducted to my small office-room to which the wooden doors,
and the heavy portières also, are to be drawn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand, your Highness. But what am I to do if
other visitors come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, little Princess Haganè, it is in such straits that your
experience of foreign social hypocrisy must be made to serve
you. It is of imperative need that you do not leave this room
after the hour of the Rat (1 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>). Yet it is also imperative
that you receive, equally, all guests. Those unbidden you
must get from the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
&quot;It is a difficult task, Lord, but it may be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a brave wife. Remember that not only from the
time of the Rat, but this hour, too, this very moment, commences
your vigilance. Tale-bearers and enemies may be lurking
near. If human ingenuity can keep a meeting secret this
will be kept, but, alas, in a time of great issues the dragon&#39;s
teeth sow spies instead of men. Do you understand all I have
said, my Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand, your Highness, and am honored to do your
august bidding.&quot; Before leaving her he gazed for another
moment steadily into her upraised face. &quot;You are pale to-day
as your name, my small snow-wife; yet your eyes move and
glitter with a strange unrest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beseech your Highness concern not your weighty thoughts
with my unimportant outer appearance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must not do so, indeed,&quot; murmured her husband. &quot;My
chief thought now must be my Imperial Master. Farewell,
little one. I shall arrive at one, if not before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki followed him to the door for a last wifely obeisance.
The carriage had been waiting for some moments. After the
loud rattling of wheels came a hollow silence. Yuki stood on
the granite doorsteps looking outward with unseeing eyes.
The house-shadow shrank closer to the huge cube that cast it.
Sunshine, like a golden fluid, brimmed up the azure walls of
day. From garden-beds nearby, and from path-borders leading
into hazy distance, blossoms beckoned. She saw only an
iridescent blur. The jinchokè (called by foreigners Daphen
Odora) rose in waxen masses of white or arbutus pink. Azaleas
heaped formless hillocks with Tyrian hues, and the long
yellow sprays of yama-buki, to which Gwendolen had so
often been compared, poised waiting for the breeze, or else
tossed in bright indignation at the sudden desertion of a
bird. Sweet odors flowed inward, and whispered her to follow.
Still half unconsciously she stepped down to the gravelled
path and began to walk in the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes, among the beautiful familiar blooms, an alien
flower smiled, a budding rose-tree, or a purple blotch of English
violets. The thought of Pierre&#39;s danger came now with
less of acid pain. Perhaps this illness was to save them both&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
Haganè. The long hospital days might bring to the
young Frenchman clearer judgment, and perhaps a more forgiving
heart. In convalescence, surely, he would wish to return
to his own land. At such times the spirit is fain to
leave the weak body, and speed on before, to childhood&#39;s home.
She had reached a cluster of the early iris. These were
Pierre&#39;s flowers, the lilies of his France. She stroked the
silken petals as though they were hands. &quot;Pierre, my poor,
poor Pierre,&quot; she breathed aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Yuki-ko,&quot; came as an echo.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki started and looked around in fear. &quot;Little flowers,
was it you that spoke my name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki,&quot; came the low voice again. &quot;Do you grieve for
Pierre? Poor Pierre is dead!&quot; He stepped out from behind
a cluster of dark cypress-trees. Yuki bit her lips to keep
from screaming. Was this the ghost of the man she had
loved?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki,&quot; said the phantom, with a little chill whine in his
voice, &quot;won&#39;t you even speak to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it you, Pierre, or is it indeed your newly fled spirit
come to reproach me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre ran his hands through his short, dry hair, then
dropped them, as if the effort had been too great. He took a
step forward. &quot;Why, yes, it is Pierre, after all. I thought
I was dead, but I am not. Yes, sweetheart, you may come to
me. It is your Pierre.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki ran to him and caught one dangling hand. It burned
her like hot metal. &quot;You escaped, in spite of your two
nurses?&quot; she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre began to whimper. &quot;Yes, yes, Yuki, I got away at
last. I had things to do. Don&#39;t send me back there, Yuki!
My room has bars, like a cage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you get away?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little Jap nurse couldn&#39;t resist me. Told me of a back
entry. Nice little nurse in white cap. Jap&mdash;cap; cap&mdash;Jap.
Ha&mdash;ha!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, dear,&quot; said Yuki, pulling him gently. &quot;I will not
send you back. You shall go with me to the little Cha no yu
rooms at the far end of this garden. There you can lie down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
until you feel better. Will you follow me quickly and in
silence along this little path?&quot; She pointed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed I will&mdash;no need to ask twice,&quot; cried the sick man,
and began to giggle like an excited child. &quot;I&#39;d follow you
anywhere, Yuki. Are we running away to be married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, Pierre; if you laugh and speak so loud others will
hear you and send you back to prison. We must be very, very
quiet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very quiet,&quot; echoed Pierre, solemnly. &quot;Never do for old
prince to hear us, oh, no!&quot; He began to mince along on the
tips of his toes, giggling every now and then at the thought of
the trick they were playing.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki sped on before him, like a fawn. At the tea-rooms
she sprang to the narrow, railless veranda, drawing a single
shoji panel carefully to one side. The two small rooms were
in order. Sunken into the floor of one was the copper hibachi,
two feet square and now filled with cold ashes, an article
indispensable to tea-rooms of ceremony. The sun pouring
against translucent paper walls flooded the small space with
radiance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What dear little rooms!&quot; exclaimed Pierre, as he scrambled
in, panting. &quot;She would call them &#39;cunning little
rooms,&#39; that yellow-haired American girl. What was her
name, Yuki? She is not a good friend to poor Pierre; she
could not swear it when I asked her. Are these the little
rooms where we are to live, Yuki, now that we have run away
from the old prince and are married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; said Yuki, soothingly. &quot;Here is where Yuki
will care for you until a betterness comes. See, I shall heap
for you these nice cushions. They are your Japanese pillows.
You must lie on them very still, and keep all these shoji shut
close until I can go and get some medicine for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; said Pierre, fractiously. &quot;Medicine no go! Kusuri,
ikanai! Too much kusuri every day at hospital. Nurses all
carry spoons in their belts. I don&#39;t need more medicine, Yuki;
only for you to kiss me. You haven&#39;t kissed me all day!&quot;
He threw himself among the bright cushions and began tossing
his head from side to side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will kiss you when I get back,&quot; said Yuki. &quot;Only promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
to lie here very quietly until I can come, and many times
I will kiss you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre raised himself on an elbow and looked dubious.
&quot;Kiss me before you start,&quot; he demanded. &quot;You break
promises, you know. And this morning you have such a
droll fashion of going suddenly far away, and then starting
back quickly, just like the end of a trombone that one is playing.
You must be a witch, Yuki, to move so swiftly through
the air. Kiss me, or I shall not believe it is really you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a heart strained to the limit of endurance Yuki knelt
beside him on the matted floor and pressed her ashen lips to
the red coal of his mouth. Pierre, seizing her with superhuman
strength, kissed her again and again, until the tortured
woman felt that she must rend the air in clamor to some
native god or demon who might save her. This passion,
branded on the soul of Prince Haganè&#39;s wife, gained a new
and terrible power of defilement. In a spasm of anguish she
wrenched herself free, went backward from him, and seized
the shoji&#39;s edge to hold herself. &quot;I will kiss you no more
until you take the medicine,&quot; she said, with a steadiness that
surprised them both.</p>

<p class="indent">He lurched forward, grasping at a swaying sleeve. She
eluded him. &quot;If you are not more controlled I will leave you
altogether, and send police to take you back to Yokohama!&quot;
He grovelled at her feet and whimpered. &quot;I&#39;ll be good.
Don&#39;t send me, Yuki. But if I lie quite still you&#39;ll kiss me
many, many times again when you return, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki hesitated. He dragged himself half upright. &quot;You
shall. I&#39;ll kill you! I&#39;ll kill myself, here! You must kiss
me. A wife always kisses her husband. Swear that you will
kiss me!&quot; The light of increased madness glared in his
beautiful eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll kiss you, I swear it,&quot; faltered the girl. Pierre
laughed foolishly in his satisfaction. &quot;Then I&#39;ll lie still
among your pillows, little wife. Old prince sha&#39;n&#39;t find us.
Put us in boiling oil, that old prince. Don&#39;t be gone too
long, little wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki hurried along the intricate paths toward the house.
Dry sobs rose one after another slowly, coming relentlessly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
upward in her slender throat with a distention that grew to
agony. &quot;I must not stop to think, I cannot give up now,&quot;
she panted. &quot;O Kwannon Sama, what am I to do?&quot; This
black hour, like some dark chemical, was turning the memory
of all other grief to light. The one conscious thought which
her mind hugged jealously was Pierre&#39;s necessity for medicine.
Fortunately, she knew a little of this, and kept a well-filled
chest. His fever was terrific. Human pity demanded that
she first allay this raving torment of the blood before delivering
him to cold officials, or even to Count Ronsard of the French
Legation. Her thoughts and plans in this present bewilderment
could get no further than the fever-draught now to be
given the sick man. With shaking hands she prepared it,
and then a second drink, a powerful sleeping-potion. She got
back to him as noiselessly as she had come. Apparently no one
had seen her. Pierre was now in actual fever-madness. He
had thrown coat, waistcoat, and watch in various parts of the
room. The cushions were strewn wide. A corner of one rested
in hibachi ashes. In one of his hands he clasped tightly the
half of a long ivory hairpin.</p>

<p class="indent">With the patience of a mother and the ingenuity of a wife
she coaxed him, at length, into swallowing one of the draughts.
He did not demand the promised kisses. He did not know her
now, or, rather, the recognitions came in short flashes, like
heat lightning. Sometimes he took her to be Gwendolen and
accused her angrily of connivance with Haganè and the ambitious
Onda family. Again he thought her the German head
physician and raved of his wrongs. He passed rapidly from
one language to the other, essaying at times his broken
Japanese. It was generally in English that he denounced
his faithless sweetheart, and the epithets directed against her
caused Yuki&#39;s heart to sink with shame,&mdash;not for herself,
but for him.</p>

<p class="indent">A longer interval of sanity came. He recognized his companion
with piteous little cries and tears of joy. He believed
that at last they were married, and prattled on of the long,
happy future, of their little home in France, until Yuki, having
come for the moment to the end of suffering&#39;s capacity,
listened with a dreary smile and dull ears.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
The second draught, the sleeping-potion, was to be given in
half an hour. Through that interminable time she waited,
his head upon her aching knees, his fevered hands reaching
ever for her face, her shoulder, until lethargy alone saved her
from an answering insanity. The plan was half formed in her
dull thoughts to administer this potion, then, when slumber
overcame him, to close the shoji, and leave Pierre to sleep away
the fiercest fever while she could think out a way of getting
him from the garden. But for the political meeting, falling
so strangely on this very day, the situation would have possessed
no great peril. It would have been merely a sick man
who, in delirium, had wandered unknowingly into Haganè&#39;s
garden. The servants might have found him; Ronsard have
been telephoned for, and Prince Haganè himself asked what was
best to do. This was what might have been; but here was the
matter as it really lay. A Frenchman, and attaché of the Legation,&mdash;ill
or well no less a Frenchman&mdash;concealed in Haganè&#39;s
garden, sheltered and protected by Haganè&#39;s young wife!
Yuki gave a convulsive shudder. The sick man gasped, and
clutched the air as if he thought himself falling from a height.
Fate smiled a thin, hard smile down into Yuki&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl did not resent Fate&#39;s prophetic stare. Already she
knew herself trapped. Her wild thoughts had run since the
beginning of eternity in this same ring of fire. There was
time for nothing. The one frail chance was that Pierre should
sleep on through the meeting undiscovered. Already twelve
o&#39;clock had come. From the high land near the samurai
Onda&#39;s home, a big bell boomed and quivered out over the city.
The echoes stirred and shifted tranquil layers of the noon.
Fear sank down like soot upon a crouching woman with the
sick man on her knees.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, for some moments past, had gradually ceased the restless
tossing of his head, and was forgetting to utter short, disjointed
words. The fair hair, that had been so stiff and dry,
clung now in moist locks about his temple. His delicate hands
ceased twitching and picking at Yuki&#39;s gown, and fell over
limply on the floor. Caught loosely in the right hand lay the
broken hairpin. To any Japanese, of any class, this would
be fatal evidence. Under her fairy-like touch he gave a start,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
clutched more firmly at the pin she was trying to take, and
threw his hand upward above his heart. Again Fate smiled,
and Yuki bowed her head. Now a soft, regular breathing
began. The healing sleep was on the sufferer. His face was
growing young and gentle. Yuki stared down into it, tearless.
Her heart, like some living entity beaten and tortured
too long, had lost the power of sensitive response. There was
only a dull, incessant aching that was becoming, already, an
acknowledged part of her.</p>

<p class="indent">He was safe. To-day&#39;s crisis, at least of the devouring
heat, was over. He would awake refreshed and clear. As for
her, everything had grown so vague and far-away she cared
very little what might happen. The insensibility of reaction
bore her outward on a warm tide. Danger lost its meaning,
and grew but a shadow-play on life. A Frenchman in
Haganè&#39;s garden, and a crucial meeting to go on in the house!
There was something piquant, fetching, in the idea. Yuki
nodded above it and smiled. Oh, she was so tired, so tired of
everything! A little malicious something was tapping, tapping,
just at the base of her brain. The ache at her heart benumbed
her. A desire, dull and insistent as the pain itself,
crept to her, just to lie upon the matting near poor Pierre and
rest. They belonged together, the weak ones. Chance and
disappointment had thrown them about like toys. What had
such as they to do with the God Haganè? Yes, she had better
fail once more, and it would be the last. Let the grave statesmen
come and go, let Haganè seek her! She had nothing to
do but the easiest of all things, just to do nothing, and all this
benumbing misery would be at an end.</p>

<p class="indent">She wondered, still smiling, in what way Haganè would
kill her. She fingered curiously the stops of a dozen fearful
thoughts, and felt no fear. Had law permitted him to carry
the two swords of his class, the short one would deal a quick
and merciful death. Since he was unarmed perhaps he would
simply let one of the servants slay her, not caring to soil his
hands with such feeble stains.</p>

<p class="indent">An influence was coming over her in rhythms, like tepid
waves. A delicious lightness blew upon her brain. She
gasped for insensibility as for music, dumb, perfumed music,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
drunk in by pores of the flesh. One small nerve of desire
began to tingle. &quot;Oh, let it go on,&quot; she cried to her soul;
&quot;have no interference! Let me pass into nothingness by this
heavenly gliding!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As from a great distance came footsteps and the sound of
commonplace voices. Yuki moaned aloud, and crept an inch
nearer her companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was seen last coming in this direction,&quot; said a speaker;
&quot;Ii, the gardener, saw her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is not in the adzuma-ya! Can it be that our gracious
lady has gone for repose to the tea-rooms?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Baka!&quot; exclaimed the other whom she now recognized as
Tora, the butler; &quot;is not that great official residence sad
enough and lonely, that the poor child seeks a more desolate
place? I pity her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Luncheon becomes honorably cold upon the table,&quot; murmured
the boy, showing compassion in his own way. &quot;And
foreign food when chilled, with the grease becoming as wax
about the edges, is of all sights the most disgusting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arà,&quot; sighed Tora, &quot;she eats little enough even when
the food is hot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those many disgraceful things said of our lady in the newspapers,&quot;&mdash;the
younger servant was beginning, when Tora
stopped him fiercely. &quot;Gossip not of your betters, boy! You
should not read such things. There are no truths in printed
scandals. Come, not that way, she is not in the tea-rooms.
I see a fresh disturbance of the gravel along this path.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To the listener&#39;s intense relief they turned sharply to the left.
Wide awake now with an intensity of sensitiveness that made
every stirring leaf an enemy, the young wife crept outward
from between two shoji, closing them with the extreme of
care. In full sight, on the veranda, lay her little foreign
handkerchief. No other woman on the place used lace-bordered
handkerchiefs. Tora must have seen and recognized
it, and, in an instant, perhaps, of protection, have led the
boy aside. Yuki&#39;s cheek burned. She dared not think Tora&#39;s
thoughts. This humiliation was a wound made with a weapon
of poor metal, yet she could not, even then, refuse gratitude
for the delicate consideration.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
As the two servants came again into the main part of the
garden, their mistress walked quite leisurely a few yards before,
stooping now and then to a flower, or gazing up with
smiles to a blossoming cherry-branch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Luncheon is served, your Ladyship,&quot; said Tora, gravely,
and bowed before her in the path.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will come immediately,&quot; returned Yuki. She did not
meet his eyes.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">During</span> the short, uncomfortable meal Tora stood like a
painted stake behind his mistress&#39;s chair. The &quot;boy,&quot; attempting
to supply the watchful efficiency his senior for once
appeared to lack, kept his small eyes darting from her white
face to the &quot;dirty wax&quot; at the edge of her plate, until Yuki
thought she must deliver herself over to an attack of laughing
hysterics. Tora poured and brought her wine unbidden.
Again she resented his presumption, again felt a cowed sense
of thanks for his solicitude.</p>

<p class="indent">Abandoning the table at the first possible moment, she went
swiftly upstairs to her own chamber and rang for the maid.
The simple morning robe of smooth silk must be changed for
a more elaborate afternoon toilette. She selected a curdled
gray crêpe with tiny silver pine-leaves sprinkled through it.
The under-robe was turquoise blue; her wide sash of blue-black
satin brocaded in conventionalized silver pine-branches.</p>

<p class="indent">The transfer went on with breathless celerity, yet the hands
of the mantel clock moved faster still. Ten minutes only
lacked to the hour of the Rat. The sound of carriage-wheels
crunching gravel rose from the drive below her. Yuki gave a
restless motion of her entire body, and turned her face around
to the maid, who now tied the great loop of the sash.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Patience an instant longer, your Ladyship,&quot; smiled the
maid. &quot;Let me but girdle your illustrious person with the
obi-domè and I shall be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here is the obi-domè,&quot; cried Yuki, her voice betraying her
impatience. &quot;I shall retain one clasp while you wind it around
the sash.&quot; She took up from among the American toilet
articles on her dresser the article desired, a flat, soft braid of
silk with golden clasps. Yuki, as she had said, held one end
against the front of her sash, while the maid dexterously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
threaded the high sash loop at the back, and brought the
answering clasp to its mate. It clicked like an old-fashioned
bracelet.</p>

<p class="indent">A servant knocked on the door. Yuki herself answered.
With mingled relief and perturbation she read on the cards
the names of Mrs. Todd and Miss Todd. It was an unfortunate
time for their visit, yet now as always the thought of
Gwendolen&#39;s presence brought a little stir of excitement, a
sweet glow of true happiness. During her flight downstairs
Yuki formed the clearest resolution that had come to her in
the distracting day. She would tell Gwendolen of Pierre&#39;s
presence. If help were possible, Gwendolen would find a way.
The new hope brought a little glow to the face which greeted
her American friends. A little talk on unimportant, pleasant
matters would refresh and steady her. For a moment only
did the bright illusion abide. Gwendolen and her mother
bore, in common, an air of hesitating excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what is wrong now?&quot; cried Yuki to them both.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you <i>are</i> quick!&quot; said Gwendolen; &quot;have we become
mere transparencies, or do your wits acquire a preternatural
alertness in these big rooms? Yes, there is something wrong&mdash;not
fatally so, only a menace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We felt it our duty, Yuki&mdash;&quot; began Mrs. Todd, on her
lowest register.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, mother,&quot; Gwendolen interrupted, &quot;you promised
faithfully to let me tell Yuki in my own way. You sound as
if you hooted from a cave. It isn&#39;t anything horrid, darling!&quot;
This last speech was directly to the princess.
&quot;Don&#39;t begin to fade away. It is simply that Pierre, who has
been ill at the German hospital in Yokohama, escaped this
morning, in delirium, and the authorities are after him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In delirium&mdash;raving in <i>delirium</i>&mdash;the poor tortured
boy!&quot; echoed Mrs. Todd&#39;s sepulchral tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, is that all?&quot; breathed Yuki. Her face showed unmistakable
relief. Gwendolen stared at her, incredulous.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd put up her lorgnette. &quot;All! Did I understand
you to say all? Is it not enough? Have you known before
to-day of his terrible illness?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed, I have not, dear Mrs. Todd. And by &#39;all&#39; I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
did not mean the heartlessness, as you think. I only meant&mdash;I
meant&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot; said the matron, suspicion deepening with the
sight of the young wife&#39;s confusion. &quot;Perhaps Pierre has
been here already. Has he been here, Yuki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki looked more embarrassed than ever. She hesitated
the fraction of an instant. Gwendolen&#39;s eyes sent out one
hazel gleam. &quot;No, dear Mrs. Todd,&quot; answered Yuki; &quot;Monsieur
has not set foot in this house since my first reception,
many weeks ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot; said Mrs. Todd again, and closed her lorgnette
with a disappointed snap. &quot;Well, there&#39;s time for him yet!
You had better look out, for if he is found here&mdash;&quot; She shut
her lips with a snap like the lorgnette-case. Because of avowed
sympathy with Pierre, the good lady had assumed an air of
displeasure with Yuki which all the new rank and wealth
could not overcome. Yuki, strange to say, liked her the
better for it. She hugged the memory of Mrs. Todd&#39;s cool
looks as a fanatic might have hugged his haircloth shirt.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen had turned away. She did not wish either Yuki
or her mother to gain a hint of her personal thoughts. At
Yuki&#39;s last statement, her quick mind had supplemented, &quot;He
has not set foot in this house. No&mdash;but the garden is wide,
the steps and galleries inviting.&quot; Yuki hid some gnawing
secret, of this she was sure. More carriage-wheels crunched
the gravel and Yuki&#39;s heart at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Gwendolen, coolly, now beside a window,
&quot;here&#39;s the Emperor come to see you, Yuki!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki ran forward gasping. Anything might have happened
on this reeling day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; laughed the other. &quot;I just teased you. But it is
some magnate, I assure you. My heavens, what a swagger!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd, hastening to her daughter&#39;s side, drew the window-curtain
farther. Her face glowed with satisfaction.
&quot;Prince Korin,&quot; she announced, &quot;he is a dear man! I shall
be pleased to meet him again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along, mother,&quot; said Gwendolen, a little brusquely;
&quot;he hasn&#39;t called on us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I sha&#39;n&#39;t do anything of the kind,&quot; said the matron, indignantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
&quot;Prince Korin took me in to dinner last week at the
German Legation. Doubtless he will be as much pleased as I
to renew the acquaintance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please do not urge your mother to depart,&quot; Yuki flung
back over her shoulder as she went toward the door; &quot;I want
to speak with you, Gwendolen, on some important matter.&quot;
Without a qualm she delivered the wondering peer into the
outstretched hands of the American lady. Drawing Gwendolen
to a corner of the big room she said, in a low and agitated
voice, &quot;He&mdash;that one we spoke&mdash;he is even now asleep in
this garden. It is terrible, but I could not send him off. I
gave medicine; he was nearly to die of great illness. Make no
sound or look of surprise; no one suspects, unless it is the
butler, Tora. Perhaps you can help me. What makes all
more dangerous, more terrible, is a secret meeting of state to
be held here this very hour. Prince Korin is the first. You
and Mrs. Todd must go before Haganè come, or he will feel
great anger to me. Your father is to arrive. Oh, Gwendolen,
do you see any way to save?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the most frightful complication I ever knew in my
life,&quot; said Gwendolen, awed for once into calm. &quot;Why, of
all days, should the meeting fall on this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some terrible crisis in war. All may depend on this hour,&mdash;our
very national existence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew something was up. Dad is cross as a bear, and
Dodge struts like a turkey. Yuki, there is but one thing.
Your husband must be told the moment he enters this house!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, if I could do that!&quot; cried Yuki. &quot;No such tearing
thoughts could I have felt. But he has given orders to me
not to disturb his mind on anything until this meeting has
passed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense, you must disobey of course,&quot; said the other;
&quot;unless I myself could get Pierre out of the garden.&quot; Her
practical American wits worked rapidly. &quot;I can do it I think.
You must have smaller gates to these high walls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, on all other days,&quot; said Yuki. &quot;But not just for
this one day. Everything&mdash;everything&mdash;for these few hours
are bolted. I think it to be karma, Gwendolen. No use to
fight for me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
&quot;Now look here, don&#39;t go into despair so soon. You say
you gave medicine. Is it a sleeping draught?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, first the strong fever-cure; then, half-hour later, a
sleeping potion. It is strong. It would keep the Japanese
asleep for many hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go to your husband, Yuki. You must do it; never mind
disobedience!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if some strange thing that you, not being Japanese,
cannot foresee should hold me back, do you think there is
other chance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; said Gwendolen, &quot;everything is in your favor.
He will sleep until after the meeting, and then you can tell
your husband. Only the risk&mdash;even a tiny risk&mdash;is so
dreadful I shrink from having you take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yesterday Haganè said to me, &#39;A wise man never leaves
something to chance,&#39;&mdash;only in such way does chance surely
serve him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll come through. Don&#39;t you fret, darling. The police
would not dare search for him here. Ah, more statesmen!&mdash;this
time in humble jinrikishas. The prime minister in a
street kuruma! It is time for me to get mother away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ignoring the scandalized side-looks of Prince Korin, Gwendolen
stooped to her friend, folded her very closely, and whispered
a low torrent of words of love, of encouragement, and
of confidence that she did not altogether feel. Fate hung dark
banners on the false battlements of Yuki&#39;s official home. The
great square shadow, creeping now toward the east, gathered
dampness. Gwendolen shivered violently as she passed under
the porte-cochère.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You needn&#39;t have been in such a nervous hurry, Gwendolen,&quot;
said Mrs. Todd, with tart asperity. &quot;Prince Korin
and I were having a delightful chat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A beggar, unusual sight for Tokio, crept in through the
wide gates toward the fine waiting carriage. The driver
leaned over, menacing the intruder with a long whip. Gwendolen
stopped him. A sudden impulse made her open and
invert her pretty purse. A few silver coins fell into one
gloved hand. She leaned down, pressed them on the wondering
supplicant, and whispered in English, &quot;You are a Japanese.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
You have a soul in that foul body. Pray for my
Yuki!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki welcomed the new arrivals, repeated her password, and
ushered them personally into the office. She stationed herself
by a window, now watching and praying that her husband
might come soon, and alone. Three more kuruma rattled in,&mdash;common
street kuruma. In the first two were Sir Charles
and a Japanese cabinet minister; in the last, Haganè. The
three fell into deep speech before the drawing-room could
claim them. Haganè led them, as if by instinct, to the office-door.
None seemed to perceive the little hostess, clutching
at a window-curtain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Lord,&quot; she faltered, coming forward swiftly to within
a few feet of her husband, &quot;may I speak&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned half-recognizing eyes. &quot;Who already have seats
in the inner office?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She named the two men. &quot;Two more of our countrymen
and Mr. Todd to come,&quot; he murmured. &quot;That makes the
number.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cannot I see your Highness a brief instant?&quot; she pleaded.</p>

<p class="indent">Two more Japanese gentlemen entered on foot. Haganè
conducted them to the door of the office. Yuki kept close to
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord, Lord&mdash;my husband!&quot; she cried in desperation.</p>

<p class="indent">The note of appeal at last carried. &quot;Any personal matter
must wait, my child,&quot; he said, not unkindly, but with a decision
that blighted hope. &quot;I thought I instructed you as to
this also.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Minister Todd arrived. He appeared both anxious and excited.
In his hand he carried a leathern portfolio filled with
papers. His nod toward her had absent-minded indirectness.
&quot;Oh, Yuki, it&#39;s you, is it? I suppose you have been coached.
Have the rest come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&mdash;in the office there, where I am to conduct you.
May&mdash;may I speak a moment, Mr. Todd?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that the office?&quot; he asked, pointing. &quot;I tell you,
little Princess Yuki-ko, big things are doing this day of our
Lord. You wish to speak with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè&#39;s face appeared between the portières. &quot;Ah, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
his Excellency of America. Now are all come. This way, if
you please, Mr. Todd. Remember, Yuki-ko, leave not this
room until I speak with you again, and, if possible, let no
guest enter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My husband,&quot; cried the girl, &quot;this matter on my heart
is no light thing. I must speak!&quot; Both men turned, frowning
slightly. &quot;We cannot attend to hearts just now, my child,&quot;
said Haganè. &quot;You must defer your communication.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That wasn&#39;t like Yuki at all to stop us at such a time,&quot;
mused Todd, as he followed his host. &quot;Your Excellency,&quot;
he said to the broad silk-clad back before him, &quot;are you sure
that we did well to rebuff that little girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am only sure, this hour, that our land is menaced.&quot;
Salutations from the other statesmen interrupted this personal
trend of talk.</p>

<p class="indent">They had passed into the office together. Yuki, standing
alone in the centre of the big room, wan with the new rejection,
watched them with a curious external interest, and
dwelt in her mind upon the difference of character exhibited
in the two vanishing backs. The hollow brass rings
of the portières hissed and clashed together. A steady arm
drew the wooden panels of the door. She heard a key turn.
She was alone on guard. With a gesture so common to Japanese
women she put both hands up lightly to her hair, patting
abstractedly the shining loops. A dizziness crept under
her eyelids. The ugly walls of the room began slowly to turn
on axes of silence. She felt her head droop with the strange
drowsiness she had known an hour before; a low moan came
from whitening lips. Staggering to a window she threw up a
sash, flung the blinds apart, and, clasping her clenched hands
upon the sill, knelt, and let her head rest upon them.</p>

<p class="indent">The inrush of the sweet spring winds, and this interval of
quiet, following so closely upon a series of bewildering events,
brought soon a balm of healing. Yuki had a nature essentially
calm and self-contained. Emotion stirred and sometimes
swept her from her feet, but it was an emotion that had
no surface-play. Each quiver of her face answered but weakly
some fundamental throb of being. She had not the usual
girlish terror to bestow on scampering mice and dark corridors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
Excitement generally steadied her. The one unruly, unclassifiable
influence in her life had been Pierre,&mdash;his strange
love-making, his exotic fascination.</p>

<p class="indent">In a little while she rose from her knees, drew a chair
toward the opened window, and seated herself. Her eyes, instead
of seeking the natural loveliness without, fell, in a new
abandonment to thought, upon the great bouquets of Hanoverian
roses woven in the foreign carpet at her feet. In the
garden-bed just beneath her, bushes of daphne, of azalea and
the golden yama-buki were in bloom. A bird, swinging on a
spray of the weeping pink cherry just across the path, sang to
inattentive ears. Bees droned incessantly. From the closed
doors of the little office came a reflected murmur. Now from
the blur of tone shot a sudden slap as of a hand struck upon
a bare table. A voice cried in English, &quot;Gentlemen! gentlemen!&quot;
and a chorus of voices, &quot;Sh-h-h&mdash;.&quot; Yuki caught
herself back to the terrific import of the moment. What were
those great men thinking and saying behind the closed doors?
And what was her small single danger to the issues they
represented? She walked down the west wall of the room
in the direction of the office. Two low French windows,
opening, indeed, to the very floor, gave upon an uncovered
balcony. She parted the glass door-frames of a window and
stood still, gazing outward, this way and that, down and along
curved paths where sunshine lay like yellow silk, and flying
shattered waifs of blossoms made wonderful wind-blown patterns.
Her eyes clung longest to a little path just skirting
a great stone lantern, for this led to certain tea-rooms at the
far end of the garden. Now she walked slowly all around the
room, pausing at the main door which led in from the front
hallway. Footsteps were advancing. Yuki opened to them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The noble Sir Onda has arrived,&mdash;father to your Highness,&quot;
said Tora.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki hesitated. &quot;Does my mother accompany him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, your Ladyship, it is Sir Onda alone. He desires audience
with my august master, but I told him I had received
orders to usher all visitors directly to your presence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right, Tora,&quot; said Yuki, trying to smile in a pleasant,
unconcerned way. &quot;Now say to my father that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span>
Highness, Prince Haganè is absent, but may return in the
space of two hours. I am engaged on certain duties at my
Lord&#39;s command. And, Tora&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your Ladyship.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See that the visitor issues well into the street on leaving,
and close the iron gate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your Ladyship.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man&#39;s words and his bow had been quite as respectful
as usual, perhaps a little more than usual, yet Yuki could not
divest herself of the impression that there lurked a threat of
comprehension, of nearness. &quot;When I have explained all to
my prince, we shall, perhaps, send good Tora away to some
country estate. I could not endure his presence if I knew he
harbored such a belief, and equally impossible is it for me to
condescend to self-defence,&quot; thought the young wife. In her
morbid state of consciousness, she could almost see, as a
clairvoyant, Tora creeping to the shoji of the tea-rooms,
parting the panels with crafty, expectant fingers; she could
hear his gasp of consternation, of not altogether displeased
agitation, as he discovered the beautiful young foreigner
asleep on the floor, as he gazed, grinning, upon the broken
hairpin.</p>

<p class="indent">Since the butler&#39;s knock, and Yuki&#39;s few words with him,
absolute silence had prevailed in the little office; the very
door seemed holding its breath. Yuki heard the panel pushed
cautiously to one side, and knew that her husband listened.
She went to her former place by the window. Now the bees
outside, and the buzz of human voices within, recommenced.
Into the latter crept vivacious exclamation. The clink of
glasses arose, and now the sharp detonation of a match;
more than once a smothered laugh was heard. Yuki sat by
the window in apparent calm; her agony of suspense would
soon be over. Those were the sounds that come at the end of
an important conference, not in the midst of it. She clenched
her little hands together within gray sleeves, and faced the
office-door, to be in readiness with her smile when the grave
procession should emerge. Another ten minutes elapsed, and
another; the garden shadows gained visibly in length. Like
a little image of propriety, she sat, and, for all her preparation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg&nbsp;339]</span>
a small shiver passed along her frame as the office-door
at last went flying aside.</p>

<p class="indent">So set had been her eyes, her thoughts, upon this door, that
she had not heard the sound of stealthy footsteps without or
the soft brushing aside of clustered shrubs. Pierre stood,
bareheaded, under the weeping cherry. The drooping branches,
each set along its entire length in single pink amethysts of
bloom, enclosed him as in a fountain. The lower part to his
knees was hidden in waves of yama-buki. The wind, now
rising, concealed with tossing sprays his trembling nook.</p>

<p class="indent">First the doors of the office, then the thick portières had
been flung aside by Prince Haganè. The notable company filed
in, the Japanese not forgetting the slight, ceremonial bow to
Haganè, who stood smiling to let them pass. The last to
emerge was Minister Todd. He bore in his hand a paper
folded and sealed. Haganè kept close behind him. As the
rest of the company came forward, making adieux to the
flushed and dignified little hostess, these two stood apart,
talking in low tones. Todd now and again tapped the paper
by way of emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, crouching among the sprays of yama-buki, saw and
heard it all. His fever and madness were, for the moment,
things that had not been. The price he would later pay for
this immunity did not trouble him now. He seemed all mind
and spirit and keen intelligence, with no encumbering body.
Nothing was impossible. He would scarcely have been surprised
had he begun to drift toward that inner room without
effort, as one sometimes drifts in dreams, and to enter unperceived
by any one but Yuki. There she stood, his sweetheart,
his promised bride, kept from him by that great monster who
towered near and kept talking to the thin American, and kept
tapping a paper that bore a great seal, red like blood. It
should be blood, Pierre thought, with a slight rise in his
excitement,&mdash;the blood of that old toad who had cheated him
of this flower. But did a toad have blood at all? Well, there
was a way to find out! When the American left he would
steal in, a new St. George pursuing an uglier dragon. He
felt now feverishly in his pockets for a knife, a pistol. He
remembered now that the pistol, a pretty toy of silver and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
pearl given him by a Parisian actress, had been left at the
French Legation. A moment after, reason again grasped
him. He smiled bitterly, calling himself a child, a fool.
Nothing could be worse for France or Yuki either than the
death of Haganè at his hands. Some other way must be
found. The Japanese themselves had a saying, &quot;If you hate
a man, let him live.&quot; Yes, let the old man live. Yuki&#39;s true
lover could yet win her, undrenched in any blood. That
paper now,&mdash;if he could secure such a paper&mdash;Haganè
would give any price for such a paper!</p>

<p class="indent">All the guests had gone but Mr. Todd. He smiled down at
Yuki and said, &quot;Well, little girl, I guess Uncle Sam has done
your country a good turn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame la Princesse is not burdened by me with state
secrets, your Excellency,&quot; interposed Haganè, with more than
his wonted haste.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand. I sha&#39;n&#39;t say more,&quot; laughed the other.
&quot;What was it, Yuki, that you tried to tell us just before the
meeting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki now could afford to smile and look demure; her
danger was over. The great strong rock of Haganè&#39;s presence
was near. &quot;The need is past now, I thank you, Mr. Todd,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, both of you. You&#39;re looking mighty young and
happy, Prince, if there are hard struggles in the nation!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was gone. Yuki, glancing upward to her husband,
was surprised and then herself embarrassed to note signs of
discomfiture on that bronze countenance. Was it possible
that Todd&#39;s light words could move him? Yuki went closer
still. She could not meet his eyes, but, oh, the restfulness,
the relief in his splendid nearness! Her explanation rushed
to her lips and hung there. After the manner of good wives,
she must first show interest in what was uppermost in his
thoughts, and afterward could gently incline him to her own
desire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that the very wonderful paper just signed, Lord?&quot; she
asked, putting up a hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè glanced at the document, then bent to his wife the
look she dreaded, yet longed for. Under it she stirred and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg&nbsp;341]</span>
quivered. &quot;You are a white flower,&quot; said Haganè. &quot;Do you
really care to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;wish not to be disrespectfully inquisitive,&quot; stammered
Yuki, &quot;only, if the importance is so great, is there not
danger to your august person in bearing it about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again Haganè smiled. His young wife hung her crimsoning
face. He put out an arm and caught her to him. &quot;Is
that your fear&mdash;you thing of snow and plum-blossom? Ah,
Yuki&mdash;Yuki&mdash;you are my wife. When this time of stress
and peril is at an end, I shall try to teach you something of a
brighter hue than duty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, high on his knees among the yama-buki, saw and
heard it all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If there be danger, you must not bear it! The risk is
terrible. Think, Lord, how our country needs you!&quot; Her
apprehension lifted her a little from self-consciousness.
Haganè&#39;s answer was calm, steady, with a thrill in it. &quot;Then
who is to bear it, small sweet wife, if I should put it down?
But, no, there must be no thought of thee and me&mdash;not yet.
I belong to the land. In all haste must I take the paper to
our Imperial Lord. Every moment means a danger. Ring
instantly for the carriage,&mdash;I must go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The single horse coupé is now being repaired,&quot; said Yuki,
in a troubled tone, &quot;and, more unfortunate, one of the pair of
carriage-horses is ill; but I can order your kuruma with two
runners.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unfortunate,&quot; echoed Haganè, in a lower tone, &quot;yet such
small annoyances beset the way of all. Ring for my stoutest
kuruma, Yuki, and have three runners. They will bear me
as swiftly as any horse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord,&quot; faltered Yuki, not moving from him, &quot;you assured
me that after the meeting I should have speech with
you. The matter is indeed of importance, perhaps of great
danger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I will listen, child, if you can be brief. But first
touch the bell and give my order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki went across the room from him. He, frowning
slightly at the delay, stood as he had been standing, his back
squarely to the office-door, his left shoulder toward the opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg&nbsp;342]</span>
French window. Yuki, not ten yards before him, had reached
the wall where the electric button was set. She raised a slim
hand to it, but before she could press it, a certain flicker as
of an animated shadow moving in the room behind Haganè
drew her curious and anxious glance. The outstretched
arm fell, paralyzed. She attempted to speak, to cry aloud,
but her throat had turned to cork. Pierre Le Beau was creeping
into the room like a thief, a cat, skirting the wall in the
direction of the office-door. He caught her frozen stare of
terror, and made a defiant gesture, commanding silence.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè raised his head. The delay puzzled him. He had
been examining again the crimson seal. The look on his
wife&#39;s face, come with such terrific suddenness, sent something
almost like fear through his heart. He thrust the paper
in his breast, and turned to scan the room. Pierre was in the
safe shelter of the columnar, massed portière.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki clawed and mowed her way through a jungle of fire
toward her lord. &quot;Master, master!&quot; she whispered hoarsely.
She could say no more, and fell prone on her knees before
him, reaching upward for his grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What ails you, child? In the name of Shaka, what has
hurt you?&quot; He bent to raise her, but she grovelled, eluding
his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am ill, very ill; let us go quickly to our chamber,&quot;
she managed to choke out. Now she fluttered backward,
luring him, like a wounded bird, her long, gray sleeves
trailing after.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In Shaka&#39;s name!&quot; he cried again, &quot;I cannot understand
the suddenness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre now left the portière, and stole softly toward the
bent back of the prince. Yuki thought him mad, with a
new strength and cunning of murderous intent. She sprang
up to her feet, hurling all her slight weight against Haganè
with such force that he swerved. With a movement like
light she had passed him, set her back to his, and was facing
Pierre. &quot;Here&mdash;here&mdash;kill me&mdash;not him&mdash;&quot; she panted.
&quot;I am ready; I do not fear. See how white my breast and
soft! Oh, blood will look so pretty here,&mdash;like the red seal!&quot;
She tore aside the dove-gray folds of her gown.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span>
Haganè, wheeling to them, half drew the paper from his
breast. The Frenchman saw, and as Haganè turned, lowered
his head so that his face might still be hidden, reached out
a hand, and, with one demon-directed dart of the nervous
fingers had touched, had clutched, had wrenched away the
long white screed of fate that bore a single drop of blood.</p>

<p class="indent">For one awful crash of time, the solid earth split beneath
the statesman&#39;s feet. Pierre had gone through the low window
like a breeze, and his flying track through the shrubs stirred
them scarcely more. Haganè staggered as his mind confirmed
this strange, annihilating loss. A moment more and he was
again calm master of his fate. He took Yuki by a shoulder,
held her from him, and scorching her eyes with the scorn of
his, said steadily, &quot;So this is what ailed you, Princess Haganè!
Why did you give no warning? Tell me the name of the thief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki blinked and moved her head backward and forward
through the air. She put up a hand to her throat of cork, and
smoothed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Answer me, Yuki, who was that man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not answer. Suddenly she sagged to his feet,
wrapping her long gray sleeves about his ankles. &quot;Oh,
Master, do not kill him! He is a very sick person, yes! I
will get the paper for you, Lord. I will get it for you, I will
get it!&quot; she chattered in English. Why, at this central
crisis of her life, she should have spoken English to a Japanese
was something that she never understood.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè looked down upon her silently. He could not
move for the coils around his feet. He saw clearly that she
had reasons for detaining him, and his mind went naturally
to the one solution. &quot;This was a lover she protected.&quot; Yet
he was calm, his grave dignity unassailable. His lips, his
chin, his down-bent lids were of metal; only at the temples,
veins sprang and stood like branches of dull red coral.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not ask again, Yuki; will you tell me the name
of the man who has gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki stared up at him through flickering lids. The air
snapped into little particles of jet and tinsel. Things were
getting the queer look. She feared that she was going to
laugh. &quot;Was there a man, Lord?&quot; she questioned.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span>
&quot;Gods!&quot; said Haganè. His nostrils blew in and out, and
still his voice was even and kind, &quot;Yuki-ko, your country,
the life of our Emperor, may be menaced by this theft. Can
any bodily passion exonerate this ultimate crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A great spasm seized the crouching woman. &quot;Lord, have
mercy on my weak heart; but I can get the paper&mdash;I alone
can get it; I will buy it for you with my life!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah&mdash;your life! We do not offer carrion to the Gods.
Unloose my feet,&mdash;poor soiled thing. Do not touch me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki hid her face against his feet. Her arms coiled like
steel bands.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly and deliberately he knelt and untwined, as he might
the tendrils of a vine he did not wish to bruise, her clinging
arms, the long gray sleeves. There was no roughness in any
movement except at the instant when he snapped the obi-domè,
intending to use it to bind her wrists. She felt his intention,
and waited craftily until he had almost drawn the
first noose, then slipping her arms away, encircled again his
patient feet, babbling, &quot;Let me get it. He was ill; he did not
know. Harm him not. I will get the paper.&quot; In her distracted
thought some other self, anterior to this, seemed to
be at a great distance, running side by side with Pierre, and
jerking out to him through failing breath: &quot;I hold Haganè
back, but it cannot last very long. Do not harm him,&mdash;I
will do what you wish, Pierre, I will be what you wish;
already Haganè casts me off, but do not harm him. Quick,
quick, poor mad boy, my strength fails! Haganè is coming&mdash;coming&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His first failure brought no impatience to the statesman.
With more elaborate care he again knotted the obi-domè and
drew it. He succeeded now in securing the fluttering hands.
His one sign of agitation was deep, heavy breathing. As he
raised his head from the task, on the white balls of his eyes
tiny crimson threads broke through. Yuki stared upward, dazed,
into his face. &quot;Look not on me,&quot; he said, as he prepared to
rise. &quot;Put your false face to the earth. If I thought a shiver
of obedience, of loyalty were left in your cringing soul, I would
command you to stay here quietly&mdash;and seek not to follow, and
so make more open this disgrace. Hide your eyes, I say!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span>
Sooner would I caress a grave-worm than thee!&quot; He pushed
her down with some violence, rose, and hurried to the rear
of the house. Yuki turned her face sidewise to follow
him. &quot;A kuruma,&quot; she heard him call, &quot;and three swift
runners! Ten yen each to the men if they start within the
moment!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stood bareheaded in the sunshine, his watch opened in
his hands. As if by invocation, the kuruma and the grinning
coolies appeared. Yuki crawled a few inches, and strained her
dry throat outward, listening for the address he was to give.
No effort had been needed for hearing. His voice had the ring,
the resonance of a deep bell, as he said aloud, &quot;To the French
Legation!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Yuki, when she was sure that the whole place had fallen
quiet, slowly lifted herself to a sitting posture on the foreign
carpet, in the very centre of a huge bunch of vermilion cabbage
roses. She gazed with intense scrutiny at one of these
unearthly blossoms. It reminded her of something, a very terrible
something, which had happened to her long ago. She tried
to put a hand out and trace the irregular circle, but something
held her hands together. She stared now at the hands, at the
twisted obi-domè. Its golden clasps, now broken, hung down
and clinked together like the toys on a lady&#39;s chatelaine. The
sight recalled her to the present, and solved the suggested
mystery of the harsh red rose. It was of sealing-wax the
flowers had reminded her,&mdash;of a great crimson seal, of
enamelled paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I kept him back quite a little while,&quot; she said aloud,
and nodded in satisfaction. &quot;Less danger will come to both
because I held Haganè back. How could he know it was Pierre?
How could he think so quickly to go to the French Legation?
Will Pierre be really there? Oh, he is a terrible man, that
great Haganè! Even the voices of the air speak to him! He
called me &#39;carrion,&#39; rather would he fondle a grave-worm
than little Yuki! Ah, his eyes said not so this morning, no,
not this morning, my great Lord Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She moved her hands restlessly in their bonds. &quot;Poor
little hands,&quot; she murmured. &quot;He tried to bind you. Shall I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
set you free?&quot; She put her ear down against them. &quot;Oh, yes,
indeed I can release you,&quot; she smiled as if the hands had answered.
&quot;The obi-domè is soft and insecurely tied. Even a
great prince like Haganè cannot tie a knot that a woman&#39;s
fingers cannot unfasten!&quot; With a few deft turns of the wrist
she loosed the cord, letting it slip to the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant she stared at the bright red marks on her
wrists, then put both hands upward to smooth the loops of her
hair. She seemed a little surprised to encounter such disarray,
and began thoughtfully to coil up, foreign fashion, the blue-black
hair which fell in streams along her shoulders. With a
little shiver she drew her kimono together at the throat. &quot;Why
did Pierre wake so soon?&quot; she whimpered. &quot;He came and
took something from Haganè. He did not understand his
own crime, being so very ill. No, he could not have willingly
slain Yuki, had he understood. Haganè said that my country,
my Emperor, may be harmed through Pierre. I must get the
paper back at once, at once! Why am I waiting? Oh, I must
go swiftly, as they went!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With spasmodic motions she lifted her trembling body
upward. The gorgeous obi, stiff with silver pine-boughs and
robbed now of the indispensable obi-domè, slipped down
about her in coils, as of a huge wooden shaving. She grasped
instinctively at the folds. Her eyes continued to search
restlessly the corners of space.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Pierre, naughty, naughty Pierre!&quot; she went on whispering.
&quot;You promised to lie still. You gave your word
to Yuki when she helped you. Now they may both need to
die,&mdash;poor Pierre and little Yuki, too. They may die with
the cherry-blossoms all dressed up for them to see! If only
my poor head would stop moving, and I could think what I
must do!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put one icy hand against her temple. With the other
she tried to keep the falling robes from catching on her feet.
Tottering and stumbling, she reached the hall-way. A
frightened servant-woman knelt near the door. &quot;Mistress,
Mistress, in Amida&#39;s name, tell me what terrible thing is
here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki half closed her lids and peered forward, trying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg&nbsp;347]</span>
recognize the speaker. &quot;Oh, Inè, is that you? Yes, a terrible
thing, two terrible things! My hair has fallen and my
obi slips away. Arrange me quickly, Inè, quickly, and call
a swift kuruma like Prince Haganè&#39;s. I must go somewhere
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kashikomarimasu&quot; (I hear and will obey), faltered the
woman, but instead of advancing, crouched backward. She
was afraid of the strange light in her mistress&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quick, I say! Did you not hear me?&quot; cried Yuki,
angrily, and clapped both hands together with a sharp sound.
The obi fell, surrounding her in one great shimmering wheel.
The terror in Inè&#39;s face brought the young wife to her senses.
&quot;It really is nothing, Inè,&quot; she said, trying hard to smile.
&quot;I had a little fall there in the drawing-room, and am dazed.
Do not concern yourself or speak to the other servants. Go
now at once and bring my long black adzuma-coat, another
obi-domè and some foreign hair-pins. I have not the time to
be entirely redressed. I will await your coming here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki stood at the foot of the steps. The servant sped
upward. From the far end of the hall came Tora. The
prearranged impassivity of his face was noticeable even to
one in Yuki&#39;s excited state. &quot;Well, Tora!&quot; she said
haughtily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you not wish me, your Ladyship?&quot; asked the man,
bowing in exaggerated deference. Yuki felt a hot wave
pass along her neck and vanish against the pallor of her
cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not,&quot; she answered steadily. &quot;But since you are
here, I wish you to order my kuruma with two swift
runners.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your Ladyship.&quot; He did not move.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You heard my order?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Highness,&quot; said the man, turning pale as he spoke,
&quot;I am only a servant, but I once lost by death a daughter of
your age. There is something I would like to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki bit her lip; a struggle went on within her. The dip
of the scales came through Inè, who now hurried down the
stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I return, Tora,&quot; said the young princess; &quot;I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg&nbsp;348]</span>
sure you mean to be kind and not presuming. I will speak to
you when I return.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tora shook his head as he turned away. As Yuki&#39;s
kuruma rattled from the gate, he went back musingly alone
toward the Cha no yu rooms.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg&nbsp;349]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Todd</span> and her daughter, in driving away from the
Haganès&#39; official home, had given the order, &quot;Suruga Dai.&quot;
To be truthful and more accurate, this euphonious, topographical
title, spoken in Japanese with a delicious softening of
continental &quot;u&#39;s,&quot; and blurred Italian &quot;g&#39;s,&quot; was, under Mrs.
Todd&#39;s crisp American tongue, transformed to the alert and
inharmonious &quot;Sew-roo-gar Da-eye.&quot; The driver, fortunately
inured to these attacks upon national enunciation, drove as
straight to the desired spot as if Yuki herself had named it.</p>

<p class="indent">Suruga Dai, so called because from its elevation can be seen
the distant plain of Suruga with its glittering single treasure,
Fujiyama, is a curious little welt of land, rising in a small
loaf through the very heart of modern Tokio. Official residences
climb the slopes, foreign homes perch at the top, Japanese
villas and gardens crown it. A fashionable hospital,
endowed by the Empress, has risen there within a decade; but,
on Suruga Dai, the dominating presence is a huge Greek
Church, built and utilized for her own purposes, by Russia.
From far down the bay of Yedo, from car windows on the
busy, curved track that leads from Yokohama, this edifice
stands as a sort of saturnine beacon. Staring, treeless, defiant,
with square white walls that hurt the eyes with their
blank brilliancy, and a squat blue-tiled roof fashioned to a
Byzantine dome, it rises above the verdure-hidden eaves of
the Imperial palace, checks the vista to many a narrow street,
and hangs, a menace and a humiliation, above the wide plain of
alien interests. Boatmen on the Sumida River, poling down
rice, and wood, and charcoal from distant villages, glance up
toward it with a scowl and a prayer. If they were Romanists
they would cross themselves and ask protection of the
Virgin. Being heathen, they merely invoke the great living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg&nbsp;350]</span>
national spirit of their race, bow reverent heads to the thought
of their Emperor, and stop at the next police-station to register
their names as volunteers for the army. Russia has claimed
to believe that the commanding position of this church is indicative
of future rulership. They have boasted openly, in the
Far East, of this coming thraldom. What the Japanese will
do with the inimical temple and its priesthood in case of their
ultimate victory over Russia is an interesting problem. With
their tolerance for all religious belief, their innate delicacy
and dignity, the foreigners who best understand them would
certainly predict an unchanged policy of forbearance.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Todd did not take a great deal of interest in Tokio
street scenes. Her mind generally streamed back like vapor
to the exalted personage she had recently left, or blew on
before to an anticipated welcome. This was the case to-day.
Rudely torn from her Prince, she was thinking of the little
Countess K&mdash;&mdash;, now in the Suruga Hospital after an attack of
appendicitis, to whom she had promised a visit. Count K&mdash;&mdash;,
one of the rising statesmen of the country, was a particular
friend of Dodge; Minister Todd also believed great things of
his future. Gwendolen, beside her mother in the open carriage,
answered intelligently, but with obvious lack of interest,
the commonplace remarks addressed to her. A foretaste, a
prescience of tragedy, lurked like a fog in the air. Companioning
Yuki&#39;s dilemma came her own,&mdash;recognized even in this
moment of irritation as incomparably less important, though
still maddening with the sting of nettles,&mdash;Dodge&#39;s foolish
devotion to Carmen, his continued coolness to herself. She
was not old yet, or experienced enough, to put herself in
another&#39;s place. Dodge was trying to hurt and humiliate her.
Worse still, he was succeeding. She needed to ponder no
further. One does not write a geologic treatise on the pebble
in one&#39;s shoe. Dodge wished to injure her. It was cowardly,
unmanly. Dodge prided himself on his Southern
blood. Gwendolen, with a sneer, thought him&mdash;or tried to
believe she thought him&mdash;a degenerate specimen of chivalry.
If at last he should attempt another overture to her friendship,
she would know well how to scorn him!</p>

<p class="indent">A great jerk of the wheels, and renewed vociferation from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg&nbsp;351]</span>
the coachman, started the horses in a nervous scamper up the
slope. Gwendolen&#39;s head went back, the hatpins tugged at
her yellow hair. She clutched at the velvet brim of her hat,
and at the same moment her lifted eyes fell on the white
walls and sagging dome of the Greek Church. The scowl she
gave it might have been borrowed from a rice-seller on his
barge. &quot;Detestable barbarians!&quot; she muttered. &quot;If they
ever <i>should</i> dominate this land!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendolen,&quot; said her mother, also jerked and unnerved
by the speed, &quot;you are far too exaggerated in your expression
of hatred to Russia. Even Cy says so. You are going to
get the Legation into trouble yet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen threw herself back into a corner and sulked&mdash;if
a thing the color of light and flowers can be said to sulk.
She went at least into partial eclipse, and retained her penumbric
mood to the hospital and within it. The pleasure
of receiving guests seemed, in the case of this little invalid
countess, to be entirely cancelled by her distress at remaining
rudely on her back, without a single bow. Mrs. Todd tried to
put her at her ease, speaking very loudly, as she often did in
talking to the Japanese, as if their ignorance of civilized languages
lurked in the ears as well as the tongue. Everything
in the room was foreign,&mdash;the white and brass bed, tables,
chairs, spoons and medicine bottles, vases, even the lithograph
framed portraits of the Emperor and Empress hanging on the
opposite wall. The nurses wore gingham dresses, aprons, and
white caps. The cloven hoof showed literally (and with
opprobrious connotation deleted) in the thick-soled white,
digitated socks on which they sped with the lightness and
swiftness of a breeze in a meadow. Relatives of the countess
came in presently, greeting and thanking the illustrious visitors
in her behalf. In spite of efforts to be at ease, the whole
visit crackled and creaked with starched formality. Gwendolen
was glad when her mother rose to go.</p>

<p class="indent">In the short drive home they passed directly by the gate
of the French Legation, and skirted the brick and plaster
wall which hides a fair garden. &quot;It is a shame for a bachelor
to keep this lovely place to himself,&quot; observed Mrs. Todd,
pensively.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
&quot;It would be a much worse shame for him to try to marry
any decent woman,&quot; said the girl, darkly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendolen! Gwendolen! What on earth has come to
you lately? You are not like yourself, these days! You
seem to hate the French as much as the Russians. Neither
nation is troubling you, just now, nor Yuki either!&quot; The
parent put up her lorgnette to study her daughter&#39;s fair,
dissatisfied face.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen went back to her corner and the sulks.</p>

<p class="indent">At the American Legation Mrs. Stunt awaited them. Mrs.
Todd went with more than usual willingness to her friend.
Gwendolen had not been an inspiring companion. The friendship
between the two elder ladies, threatened as we have
seen by certain events at Yuki&#39;s first reception, had received
some skilful soldering, and, being new-painted by Mrs. Stunt&#39;s
voluminous explanations, had a fictitious lustre. Mrs. Todd
was neither far-seeing nor revengeful, yet, quite often now
she passed a thoughtful finger across the soldered spot.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen went alone to a smaller reception-room. She
wished to know above all things whether her father was now
with Prince Haganè. There was but a single source of information,&mdash;Mr.
Dodge. At first she thought of going to him in
person. What was that &quot;snip,&quot; or his opinions, compared with
Yuki&#39;s danger? Her courage faltered, and she compromised
with it by a short note sent into the office by a servant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mr. T. Caraway Dodge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Dodge</span>,&mdash;Kindly inform me whether my father,
Mr. Todd, is in the office. If not, where he has gone, and at what
hour he is expected back.</p>

<p class="cnobmargin">&quot;Very truly,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Gwendolen de Lancy Todd</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In a very few moments she flushed, and bit her lip over the
following reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Miss Gwendolen de Lancy Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Todd</span>,&mdash;Your father, Mr. Todd, is not in this office.
I am not at liberty to communicate the name of the place to which he
has gone. He expects to return about 2.30 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span></p>

<p class="cnobmargin">&quot;Very truly,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">T. Caraway Dodge</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span>
&quot;Pshaw! I might have known it!&quot; said Gwendolen, under
her breath, as she tore the note to small pieces. She looked
at her watch. &quot;Just one, and he can&#39;t get here for an hour
and a half. What shall I do until he comes?&quot; As if in
answer, the luncheon-bell rang. She moved toward the big
dining-room, dreading to see Mrs. Stunt. Yes, she was there,
wriggling, smiling, opening her innocent blue eyes, as usual.
Gwendolen&#39;s greeting was civil, and no more. She sat through
the meal in silence, and ate practically nothing. Mrs. Stunt
tried a few tactful remarks about the girl&#39;s &quot;being in love,&quot;
as a reason for the lack of appetite. After the unquiet meal,
Gwendolen saw, with new dismay, that the ladies were to take
possession of the main drawing-room. This deprived her of
the solace of her piano. She wandered aimlessly about the
big rooms, starting a letter to an American friend, and desisting,
after the first page, pulling out bureau drawers, and
forgetting why she had opened them, doing, in fact, all those
vague, self-irritating things that indicate a perturbed and
joyless mind.</p>

<p class="indent">She longed for intelligent human companionship,&mdash;for her
father. When dad should come, she told herself, she would
lose this restless heart. She longed for him and his counsel
with a physical hunger. Her mind veered again and again
to Dodge, only to be whirled off fiercely. Mrs. Todd as a
confidante was impossible, even had the wily Stunt not claimed
her. Secure in the conviction of a commonplace mind, good
Mrs. Todd would have rushed at once to the Haganè residence,
demanded instant audience of Haganè, and failing in that have
hastened to the Cha no yu rooms to rescue her ailing protégé.
No, Mrs. Todd, with all her kind heart, could not be trusted!</p>

<p class="indent">The moments passed somehow. Gwendolen saw, through
an upper window, her father&#39;s approach. He came in a
hired street kuruma. Even at this distance she could see
that the strain was gone from his face, if not the excitement.
He caught a glimpse of her, smiled, and waved to her. Before
the girl could reach him, he had entered the office and confronted
Dodge. Now she was brave. With dad to guard her,
she could brave a hundred such as Dodge. She burst in upon
them, giving the coolest of nods to the secretary, and pouring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg&nbsp;354]</span>
without warning, a series of petitions and exclamations upon
her wondering father. At last he made out that she wished
to see him alone. Dodge had been quicker. Already the
inner door of the office closed behind him. Todd turned from
the blank panel to his daughter. The teasing twitch was on
his thin lip, the sparkle in his eye! &quot;No, no, I can&#39;t stand
it just now,&mdash;I&#39;m worried, oh, so horribly worried, and you
must help me, dad, as you always do. Am I not your only
little girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You rascal,&quot; said Todd, seating himself, and drawing her
down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything but a rascal to-day, dad. This trouble is real.
Yuki may be in danger,&mdash;I can&#39;t help her. I have thought
and thought and thought, until my brain goes round like flying
ants in the sun. I can&#39;t help. I am an impotent, miserable,
feminine girl. What did you see at Yuki&#39;s house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I saw only what I went to see,&quot; answered her
father. He gazed with some concern on the chatterer, as if
indeed she were light-headed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The meeting is over safely, then, and nothing happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The meeting is over! How did you know of it? The
meeting is over and everything happened. History may be
changed because of it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then Pierre did not wake up? Don&#39;t think me crazy,
dad! I can see that you do. All that time, while you
statesmen were closeted with Haganè, Pierre Le Beau lay
asleep a little way off, in the garden. Now perhaps you will
see what has worried me!&quot; She gave a triumphant look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Lord!&quot; said he. Then again, on a higher note,
&quot;Good <i>Lord</i>!&quot; He put her from him, rose, and began walking
the narrow room. Gwendolen nodded in satisfaction. At
last he was stirred as deeply as she could wish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki isn&#39;t to blame. He wandered to that garden in
delirium. He must have gone there first thing, for she
doesn&#39;t know how long he had been in hiding. When she
discovered him, the gates were already barred, and Haganè
had given her instructions. His fever was awful. She gave
him medicine for it, and then a heavy fever mixture, and put
him to sleep in the Cha no yu rooms!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg&nbsp;355]</span>
&quot;Haganè being in ignorance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. She said she was going to try her best to tell him
before the meeting, though he had commanded her not to distract
his thoughts. She was going to try anyhow, but if she
failed, there was nothing for it but to trust the good Lord to
keep him asleep until after the meeting, and then to tell her
husband immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd gave a deep breath as of relief. He pushed the hair
back from his forehead. &quot;God! It was a risk. She is too
young to face such tragic responsibilities! Poor child! poor
child! But I guess it&#39;s all right now!&quot; Gwendolen heard
him mutter.</p>

<p class="indent">She caught his arm. &quot;You think she is safe? You left
husband and wife together?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and he looked at her as though she were an angel
just come down. I even dared to tease him a little. I told
him he looked young and handsome! The old War God
almost blushed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the smile on his face turned gray. He stood perfectly
still, his long arms dangled. Life and youth ebbed
from him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father! Father!&quot; cried the girl, in agony. &quot;What is it?
A terrible thought has come to you! Don&#39;t hold it back. I
must hear. I will go mad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd seated himself, and touched his handkerchief to his
lips. &quot;I think I had better not speak it, daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, <i>tell</i> me!&quot; said Gwendolen, fiercely. &quot;Look at me,&mdash;look
into my eyes, father. I have your own strong spirit!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I was coming home,&quot; began Mr. Todd, obediently,
through whitening lips, &quot;I walked the first part of the way,
you know, to cool my excitement. The meeting had been
terrific in importance,&mdash;terrific&mdash;&quot; he paused.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen was now on her knees, reaping every look, every
word, with her bright eyes. &quot;Yes, yes; Yuki may be in danger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A group of fellows were standing in front of the British
Legation,&mdash;Potter, Wyndham, and some others. They stopped
me, and were chaffing and joking as those English try to do,
when a rickshaw with three runners whizzed by like a Kentucky
handicap, and there was Haganè sitting bolt upright,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span>
with a face like an old N&#333; mask. &#39;That&#39;s deuced odd,&#39; says
Wyndham; &#39;not ten minutes ago a yellow-headed foreigner
without a hat went by at the same pace. Looks as if Haganè
were on the scent.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, oh; did he say that the first was&mdash;Pierre?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he didn&#39;t say it; he didn&#39;t need to. They all looked
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For one instant Gwendolen cowered against her father&#39;s
knees. Then she rose, straight, tall, self-possessed, and held
a hand down to her father. &quot;Come, dad,&quot; she said, almost
with a smile, &quot;we have no time to lose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sprang up, facing her. The faces glowed with the same
purpose, a white fire reflected from surfaces of ivory. Both
pairs of eyes burned to black jet. &quot;Come, then,&quot; he said
simply. He took his hat in passing. She was bareheaded.
A sealskin cap was lying on Dodge&#39;s desk. She caught it up,
as her father had done his hat. Hand in hand they hurried
out, Dodge, in wonder, watching them. They went down the
Legation hill and there summoned kuruma, with two runners
apiece, promising a good reward for haste. Only once the
girl spoke. &quot;Oh, dad, my heart weighs me to the earth with
its whispers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the Haganè home they were told that every one was out.
Gwendolen&#39;s quick eye saw that the servants were frightened,
demoralized. She insisted on having English speech with
Tora. He came sulkily, and at first refused to understand
her words. This man&#39;s need for self-control gave Gwendolen
her most unbearable twinge of apprehension. &quot;Tora!&quot; she
cried aloud, &quot;I love your mistress. I am good friend of
Prince Haganè. We wish to do only good things. Don&#39;t you
understand? I love&mdash;good&mdash;we will do <i>good</i>, not harm.
Tell us where she went.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tora studied the two faces intently. &quot;Both Master and
the Princess Yuki-ko went ve&#39;y quick, French Legation. Mooch
troubles, I think.&quot; He turned away, as if wishing to say no
more.</p>

<p class="indent">The eyes of the two Americans met again. &quot;That is a place
where I cannot take you, unannounced, my dear,&quot; said Mr. Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a place, too, where I think I could do little good.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg&nbsp;357]</span>
But she is unharmed; that is certain. Ronsard cannot afford
to have violence there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t fancy things more terrible than they are,&quot; said Todd.
&quot;I myself am full of hope. If I can get in at all, I can help
explain. In the meantime, be very cautious, and go home
quietly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, go home quietly to wait! Oh, I knew that was coming.
To wait, to be stretched out flat on the rack of hours,
with every little red-hot minute pinching me. But I will go.
I trust you, dad, to do the best. I will wait patiently, as
meekly as Yuki herself could wait. That is all I don&#39;t like
about Yuki,&mdash;her meekness. Oh, my poor darling, what will
those vile men do to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again at the Legation gate she dismissed her two coolies,
paying them an incredible sum for immunity from bartering,
and walked in, along the gravelled driveway, on foot. Dodge,
who had never left the neighborhood of his office window, felt
a renewed thrill of rapture at the sight of his cap, set like a
brown, inverted bird&#39;s-nest, on her bright curls. It would be a
different cap. No one should wear it after this consecration.
He watched the slight figure with yearning tenderness. Something
in her walk, a sort of suppressed excitement in her
whole person, showed to him. The unusual hung about her.
Deliberately he came out from his den to follow. She gave
no backward glances.</p>

<p class="indent">Across the front of the Legation she hurried, taking a path
that led into the garden and wide lawn at the right. At its
rim she poised, uncertain; then, as if coming to a swift decision,
took a diagonal course across the turf. Exactly in the
centre of the wide, green space grew a clump of gigantic
mushrooms with white tops and thick blue bodies. As she
neared them the mushrooms began to bob and nod in an agitated
fashion, while funny little hissing breaths came from
the midst. They were the professional lawn-weeders,&mdash;little
old women with round faces and high cheekbones, each armed
with a pygmy sickle. They worked in a tiny grazing squad,
devouring, root and all, each intruding tuft of clover, dandelion,
pilewort, and even the spring messenger, tsukushimbo,
beloved of Japanese children.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg&nbsp;358]</span>
&quot;Kon-nichiwa,&quot; cried the girl, in her high, sweet voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kon-nichiwa (good day), o jo san,&quot; responded the little
company, rising, as corks on a single wave, and bobbing down
again as one.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen, interested in spite of her anxieties, stood still
to watch them. Dodge, unperceived, leaned against a kiri tree
at the edge of the lawn, with eyes only for her.</p>

<p class="indent">Their blue backs with a white ideograph bore the unanimity
of a pack of cards. &quot;I feel just like Alice in Wonderland,&quot;
thought the girl. &quot;Oh, I know I am Alice. They have been
painting all the dandelions white. Was this done by order of
the duchess?&quot; she asked aloud, and touched a snowy flower
with her foot.</p>

<p class="indent">The little dame nearest sent up a shy, sparkling glance,
&quot;Hek! hai! Udzukushii tampopo gozaimasu!&quot; (Ha, yes, unusually
fine dandelion honorably is!) She flushed crimson,
and went feverishly to work again in the shadow of the tall
golden one.</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen watched them for a few moments longer. She
seemed again to be undecided, for she looked first toward the
house, then outward, to the far end of the garden, where a
clump of young sugi trees made a fragrant, shadowy retreat.
&quot;That awful Mrs. Stunt must be gone by this. I believe I
will go in and let Chopin make me more wretched still,&quot; she
was thinking. She looked more wistfully toward the far corner.
&quot;No, I&#39;ll just go over there and have out one big, good
cry, with no one to bother me. If I cry in the house, mother
will bring me aromatic spirits of ammonia.&quot; Acting on the
latter impulse, she started, running now toward the trees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arà! it runs well!&quot; whispered one of the grass-cutters to
a neighbor. &quot;These foreigners all have big, strong legs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never can tell the foreign men from the foreign women,&quot;
remarked another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>D&#333;</i>-mo! you simpleton!&quot; retorted the first. She was
the one to whom Gwendolen had spoken directly, and though
covered with confusion at the moment, now vaunted herself
upon the incident, and prepared herself to take precedence in
all comments concerning the strange doings of &quot;I-i-jin.&quot;
&quot;<i>D&#333;</i>-mo! it is easy to observe. The men have upper bodies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg&nbsp;359]</span>
square, like a box, and this box is tightly covered with woollen
cloth. From the lower corners of the square come two stiff
legs, like posts. Now the women show no legs at all, but the
middle of the body is shrunken very small, like a sakè gourd
about which a string has been tied when it is green. Poor
things, it must surely hurt them to be so bound. It is a practice
more strange than that of encasing feet, used by Chinese
women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They all look alike to me, I say,&quot; repeated the first, unimpressed
by this erudition. Perhaps the boastful breath of
the speaker awoke a small coal of obstinacy. &quot;The children
are small in size, so I know them to be children; but all faces
are alike, as the faces of cows, pigs, and horses are alike, and
all are hideous!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That one, now, was not so frightful of aspect,&quot; ventured
a kindly third, and pointed her sickle to the spot where
Gwendolen, having climbed a low hillock, just disappeared
beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That one would have been almost good to look at, but for
its nose!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The noses of all are like these sickles,&quot; said the dogmatic
first.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddha teaches us to be content with what cannot be
changed. Perhaps to the foreigners themselves the sharp
noses are even beautiful!&quot; said the gentler critic.</p>

<p class="indent">A chorus of hisses and low laughs greeted this unheard-of
generosity. The little speaker flushed under the shower of
raillery, but did not abandon her humane position. Something
in the American girl&#39;s face had flashed excitement, a new interest,
a feeling almost like recognition, into her narrow vista.
She hoped she would be called to work often in this huge
garden, where the bright-haired o jo san might wander.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the hillock which rose in front of the little sugi
grove, corners of rough stone stuck out, and shrubs had been
planted, chiefly of azalea. Mingled with the many-colored
blossoms, there curved long wands of yama-buki, that most
golden flower, the gorse of the Far East. For once Gwendolen
passed these waves of beauty by. Down there, over among
the tree-trunks where the ground was winter-strewn with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg&nbsp;360]</span>
fragrant brown shreds of leaves, one could sit and cry to one&#39;s
heart&#39;s content. Deliberately she held back the fast-rising
sobs until the haven was gained, and then, hurling herself to
earth, gave vent to her grief and prophetic fears. &quot;Oh, my
poor little Yuki! What are those hard men saying to you
now? What will they do if they think you wrong? And
I can&#39;t help you! I can do nothing! Oh, I wish we hadn&#39;t
come to this place! Will any of us ever be happy again? I
have my own grief, but I hide it, ashamed, before your peril!
Oh, my little sister, my only little sister! If I could only
catch you up like a drifting petal, and hide you in my heart,
and run away with you back to our other home, back to schooldays,
and happiness! But we&#39;ll never be young again, we&#39;ll
never be happy. Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh, my heart will break!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The azaleas stared down in stately dignity; the yama-buki
tossed dissent. On a sugi limb quite near, a row of sparrows
placed themselves, slowly puffing out their feathers in unison,
like so many buns in a warm oven. They cocked their heads
suspiciously toward the prostrate girl, and gossiped about her,
saying she had stolen her hair from the sun.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge, half ashamed of himself, but led on by something
stronger than conventionality, passed the nodding group of
weeders, answered their salutation in an absent-minded fashion,
and continued a slow but unswerving route toward the
sugi trees. At the hillock he paused. A curious sound on
the other side drew him upward. His brown head pushed
a way through the yama-buki limbs. Gwendolen was crying.
He stared, not half believing his senses. Gwendolen, the
gay, insouciant, defiant, enchanting Gwendolen, weep like this!
Sooner should the stars send down beams of soot!</p>

<p class="indent">A big something that partook of the physical nature of a
hedgehog burrowed upward in his throat. Something sweet
and unaccustomed stung his lids.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my heart will break!&quot; sobbed the girl once more.
&quot;There &#39;s nobody to help me! There&#39;s nobody to listen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a single bound Dodge had cleared the hillock and was
on his knees beside her. A startled, upward look met him,&mdash;expectation,
a wild joy, new bitterness,&mdash;these flashed in
turn across her expressive face. With a wide movement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg&nbsp;361]</span>
resistance, she turned away from him and buried her tear-stained
face upon her knees.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge stood instantly. &quot;Do you mean that I am to go?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Sobs alone answered him. She could not drive him away.
His presence, his nearness, were appallingly sweet. Neither
could she yield tamely where she had promised herself a
policy of condescension.</p>

<p class="indent">Despairing of further verbal instruction, and glad in his
heart that the repulse had not been more vehement, he walked
off a few paces, and seated himself against a tree. Gwendolen
held her breath until he was safely on the earth again.
She could not have borne his instant desertion. All he had
to do now, Dodge was well aware, was simply to wait, and
be still. The one thing impossible to Gwendolen was indefinite
silence. Even before he began to expect them, the
hysterical words came fluttering, as on broken wings, to his
ear. &quot;I suppose you are glo&mdash;glo&mdash;<i>glo</i>ating on this scene of
my&mdash;agony! You li&mdash;li&mdash;like to see me hideous, with red-rimmed
eyes and a gar&mdash;gar&mdash;<i>gar</i>net nose!&quot; Again the head
went down, and the tiny lace ball of a handkerchief came into
requisition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t see your eyes, Gwendolen, or your nose, either.
I am not looking for them. But if they were emerald green
it wouldn&#39;t phase me. You are in trouble. I didn&#39;t know
you could cry like this. I wish I could be of some aid, some
little comfort to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Never before had he called her &quot;Gwendolen&quot; in this grave
assured tone. No mere love-sick boy could have done it.
The voice was that of a man, with a man&#39;s power and mastery
and self-respect. The woman in her put up a protecting
hand, but the deeper nature responded with smiles. Reason,
instinct, affection; clamored, like insistent children, for the
boon of grace. Her heart leaned down to them. &quot;Recognize
him,&mdash;confide in him,&mdash;win him now, forever,&quot; cried the
voices. &quot;Nothing can help you, in a time like this, as his love
might help. You need him, foolish one,&mdash;why not admit it
and have peace?&quot; But Vanity and Pride put on horrid masks,
and frightened the petitioners. She kept her eyes hidden.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg&nbsp;362]</span>
&quot;Well, shall I go or stay?&quot; asked Dodge, calmly. The
young man listened in admiring wonder at his own smooth
tone. How could his thumping heart and brain direct that
tranquil flow?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are wel&mdash;wel&mdash;welcome to stay if you care to. I don&#39;t
own the grove,&quot; said the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge picked a bit of leaf from the earth and began to
shred the frail, brown lace. &quot;I was awfully sorry, Miss Todd,
not to be able to tell you this morning where the Minister
had gone. I am only a servant, you know, and must obey
orders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s no matter,&quot; said Gwendolen, airily. She was
elated to find her spirits, her self-confidence, returning in a
tide. &quot;I know all about it now,&mdash;a good deal more, I dare
say, than you yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know nothing, except the place where Mr. Todd was to
go and the purpose of the meeting. He was about to tell me
the result of it, when you came in and carried him off in
triumph!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in triumph,&mdash;good heavens, not in triumph. This is
the most awful day of my life!&quot; She lifted her head now,
throwing it backward to the slight wind, and drawing deep
breaths. She expected him to urge her confidence, to ask, at
least, what trouble had come to her. Already she had more
than half decided to tell him all. He was a safe confidant,&mdash;one
of whom her father would approve,&mdash;and&mdash;she must
admit that, at times, he had clear judgment. He kept an
irritating silence. Gwendolen began to fidget.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, don&#39;t you care whether I suffer or not? I thought
you said you wanted to help me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want it more than I want anything else in the world,
except one thing,&quot; said Dodge, and moved two trees nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well,&quot; cried the other, nervously, &quot;I shall tell
you. I have been simply dying to tell somebody. To bear
a suspense like this all alone is like keeping your fist in a
water dyke,&mdash;or barring a door with your arm, or some of
those dreadful heroic things.&quot; Hampered at first by a constantly
recalled determination to maintain her dignity, she
began the exciting history of the day, starting from the moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg&nbsp;363]</span>
when she heard of Pierre&#39;s escape, and ending with the visit
of her father and herself to the deserted Haganè mansion.</p>

<p class="indent">Dodge listened to all with an interest that a barometer
might feel. He was silent, except for a very few terse,
direct questions. Not an exclamation escaped him, and not
a point. As she neared the end, Gwendolen&#39;s voice gave way,
and the little handkerchief was raised. Dodge moved a tree
nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now tell me what you think, tell me truly. I have
buried my own thoughts in the earth, and sit here on their
grave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let my thoughts go there with yours, dear,&quot; said her companion,
mournfully. &quot;The affair is as bad as it could well
be. Luck alone is going to save your friend, and from what
I have seen and known of Miss Yuki, she doesn&#39;t seem marked
out by good luck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not resent his hopelessness. Apparently she had
foreseen it. The telling of her story had eased while it had
wearied her. She gave a long, sobbing sigh, like a child, and
let her head droop.</p>

<p class="indent">Before she knew it Dodge&#39;s arm was around her. &quot;I&#39;d
give my life to keep this and all other sorrows from you,
Gwendolen. But all I can offer now is&mdash;myself. Come to
me, darling, put your poor tired little head against me, and
let me try to comfort you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl began to tremble piteously. In her nervous state,
the brimming tears soon overflowed. &quot;No&mdash;no&mdash;&quot; she
whispered, trying to push him off. &quot;It is not me you love,&mdash;you
are Car-car&mdash;<i>car</i>-men&#39;s! She said so. You belong to
Car-Carmen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I belong to Carmen&#39;s cat!&quot; cried Dodge. &quot;What am I
to Carmen or Carmen to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you de&mdash;ceived her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw! I&#39;ll make Carmen a sugar man in my image.
She&#39;ll like that lots better. I love only you&mdash;only you, you
beautiful, golden, tormenting angel of a girl! If you hadn&#39;t
kept me on pins and needles, I wouldn&#39;t say it! I love <i>you</i>,
I say. How could any man in his senses ever love any other
woman after once seeing you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[pg&nbsp;364]</span>
Gwendolen tried to be stern. &quot;No,&quot; she said again, &quot;you
don&#39;t love, you don&#39;t respect me. You were horrid that day!
You defied me to my face. You wouldn&#39;t apologize. Will you
apologize now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed I won&#39;t,&quot; he cried with a ring of victory. &quot;I&#39;d be
a mucker and a sneak to do so, and you would never want to
look at me again. Deny it,&mdash;and deny that you love me,&mdash;oh,
Gwendolen, Gwendolen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a little sob, in which a golden feather had been caught,
she leaned to his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">He took up the little brown sealskin cap, flung it back to
her head, and, in his most boyish, impudent, and ecstatic tone,
said in her ear, &quot;You know the penalty for wearing another
fellow&#39;s hat?&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg&nbsp;365]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> his favorite small smoking-room at the French Legation,
crammed with motley Japanese and Gallic bric-a-brac,
Count Ronsard fumbled nervously with his nether-lip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You sent for me, your Excellency?&quot; said the secretary
Mouquin, at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Allons! Entrez! It is the devil!&mdash;what our English
cousins call &#39;the beastly bore.&#39; But for his mother, the
Princess Olga, I would wash my hands entirely!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He went through the gesture, revolving one fat pudding of
a fist about the other, and closing with an outward fling of
both, and a shrug that made his body quake. &quot;No news
at all, Mouquin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing decisive, your Excellency. A mere hint, a
hushed rumor, that Le Beau was last traced to the neighborhood
of Prince Haganè&#39;s official residence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sacrebleu! You should have probed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I asked a few questions guardedly. Your Excellency,
one hesitates to put a match to a powder-train.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite true, Mouquin. And when did the hushed rumor
have it that he was seen,&mdash;what hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Before noon,&mdash;not long, in fact, after his mysterious
escape from the nurses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard&#39;s head dropped forward an inch. A sickly glow
drove the usual gray pallor from his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doubtless,&quot; ventured the secretary, &quot;Monsieur Le Beau
will find his way sooner or later&mdash;to you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainement! Certainement!&quot; cried the other, finding
relief in sarcasm. &quot;He will come weeping to the arms of
Mother France. Bah! I would that Mother France could
greet him with the toes of these boots!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He thrust forward pointed patent-leather tips, and stared
at them, as if calculating the punishment they might inflict.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg&nbsp;366]</span>
Mouquin, not being asked to find a seat, still stood by the
door. The very air of the room held in solution, with its
blue smoke, the dampness of foreboding. The first secretary&#39;s
voice sounded thin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The doctors think this mad exposure means his certain
death, your Excellency.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Death! H&#39;m! He&#39;ll take good care to stay alive till
we&#39;re all involved. It&#39;s too late for him to die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other raised his brows but made no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have an absinthe, Mouquin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without noticing that Mouquin shook his head Ronsard
leaned over heavily and poured a little of the liquid into a
glass, filling it up with water. Without drinking, he stared
as if he saw a vision in its milky depths.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just a chance&mdash;the air is thick with plots&mdash;Pierre might
be feigning&mdash;the Princess Haganè&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps
connives, betrays&mdash;Pshaw!&quot; Count Ronsard dreamed
under his breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No further orders, your Excellency?&quot; asked the younger
man, patiently, his hand on the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;yes! Bring me the first news of that wandering
lunatic&mdash;and avoid the police!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words fell before a fury of feet that bowled down the
outer corridor. The door burst open, nearly flinging Mouquin
to the floor. Pierre Le Beau reeled in, crimson, panting,
wild-eyed, hatless, and waved at the startled minister a
large paper sealed with a red seal, round and clear as a Japanese
sun. Ronsard in the millionth part of an instant
recalled himself. He sat erect, but his eye gleamed beady
and keen as a rat&#39;s. He was holding back with impartial
judgment a riotous flush of hope. But Mouquin, as if hypnotized,
locked the door and backed up against it. Pierre&#39;s
eyes caught the cloudy green of the absinthe, still standing
in the minister&#39;s glass. He tottered toward it, tried to speak,
but merely pointed in jerks with his free hand. Ronsard
silently held out the glass and motioned to an empty chair.
Pierre drained the drug standing, then fell rather than
sat. A sweat sprang suddenly to his skin. The fair hair
plastered itself in little brown sickles on his white forehead.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg&nbsp;367]</span>
&quot;What is it, Pierre?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard&#39;s eyes had not left the document half crumpled
in Pierre&#39;s fist. His voice had a bracing echo. A returning
wave of unhealthy strength warned Pierre to action.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes!&quot; he cried, swaying across the table, holding out
the paper and shaking it up and down. &quot;I&#39;ve done it!
What you wanted! Sold my honor to Hell for it! Quick!
Quick! America! The war!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre&#39;s head, not yet balanced by the stealthy drug, reeled,
and the large envelope dropped on the table. Ronsard recognized
the great Cabinet seal. With a wolfish twitching at
the corners of the mouth, which his utmost effort could not
control, he slowly pushed his hand across the polished mahogany.
Then two currents of thought met, and he paused.
The fretfulness, the lax instability of flesh, were gone. He
sat stiff, a compact mass, in his broad chair. One could see
that behind the ample jowl stretched a great square bone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First, what is it, Pierre?&quot; he repeated coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre rocked in his seat. &quot;A state paper&mdash;of utmost
import&mdash;signed by Grubb and Todd and all the Japanese!&mdash;It
means alliance!&mdash;I saw them all as I crouched in the
garden. Read it, quick! The wax is hardly set.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard&#39;s mouth watered, but his brain grew firm.
&quot;Wonderful! Past belief!&quot; he said. &quot;But tell me how
did Monsieur&mdash;obtain possession?&quot; He was measuring the
depth of Pierre&#39;s insanity, gazing desperately for signs of
returning judgment. &quot;Is it safe for <i>me</i>?&quot; he continued
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God, man!&quot; cried Pierre. &quot;Here I win you, with
my life, perhaps, the very key to this war&mdash;to history for
all time&mdash;and you prate about safety! Is war safe? Is
anything safe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard&#39;s voice came low and stinging. &quot;Tell me! Where&mdash;and
how&mdash;did you get it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre was too over-wrought to lie, even had he dared.
He swaggered. He stretched forth a hand and snatched
the paper defiantly. &quot;I took it&mdash;yes, from the body of
Prince Haganè! Glorious, wasn&#39;t it? Mon Dieu! Think
of it! In his official residence!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg&nbsp;368]</span>
&quot;It means the Cross of the Legion of Honor,&quot; said Mouquin,
weakly, against the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haganè!&quot; Ronsard had exclaimed in spite of himself.
He knew it meant the utmost of something, but which&mdash;glory
or dishonor? Either was incredible. &quot;Yes, yes,
Pierre,&quot; he said soothingly, as to a child; &quot;Haganè&#39;s body&mdash;I
understand. But why&mdash;didn&#39;t&mdash;Haganè stop you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? It is droll&mdash;he could not! He was tied, tangled.
His feet were tangled&mdash;yes, tightly entangled! He was too
busy with that to follow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre&#39;s laugh turned Ronsard sick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What or <i>who</i> entangled him, Pierre?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You keep her name out of this, damn you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard&#39;s pendent underlip went gray to the root. &quot;Then
she will die, too.&quot; He breathed it to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether Pierre heard or not, his tense attitude relaxed.
He cowered back in his chair. Mouquin, thinking he had
fainted, ran forward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! No more absinthe! No medicine! Coffee! For
God&#39;s sake, coffee! That may keep me up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A new thought flashed to Ronsard. &quot;Mouquin! Ring,
and yourself receive the coffee&mdash;just outside the door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His words rang quick and clear. &quot;We must think, now,
like gods or demons for swiftness,&quot; he went on to Pierre.
&quot;Haganè will be with us at once! How did you keep
ahead? You must deny, <i>deny</i>! Don&#39;t you see, it compromises
France?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre raised his eyes sleepily. &quot;Haganè&mdash;come? No,
Excellency! he did not see&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame will tell him, fool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never! She will die first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, allow me, then, to congratulate you,&quot; Ronsard permitted
himself to sneer. Then swiftly, &quot;You have been
seen! The servants! The police&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Excellency,&quot; chattered Mouquin, darting a ghastly
face through the door, &quot;Prince Haganè is announced. He
is coming down the hall&mdash;he is <i>here</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I heard footsteps. Hold him, just a moment.&quot;
Ronsard rose to his feet. With a low whisper that stung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg&nbsp;369]</span>
with the lash of a knout he bent to Pierre. &quot;Stand, you
fool! And if you have never known what it is to be a man,
try the feeling now! Hide the paper in your breast. There!
Smile, though your face crack!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre thrust the document into his coat and rose to greet
Haganè, who entered calm, dignified, and stately, not a fold
out of place, nor a hair ruffled. If any characteristic were
intensified it was in deliberate tardiness of advance, an undue
rigidity of self-restraint. He bowed deeply to Count Ronsard,
ignoring, for the moment, the presence of the younger
men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Excellency will be surprised, perhaps annoyed, at
this unceremonious call. It concerns a personal matter which
could not be delayed. There is nothing official, you understand.
It lies between Monsieur Le Beau and myself.&quot; He
turned now to Pierre with the slightest inclination of the
head, and then bowed more deferentially to the flaccid
Mouquin by the wall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything that brings your Highness is an honor,&quot; returned
Ronsard, himself placing a chair for the great man.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè seated himself with the same painstaking calm.
As he did not speak, his host continued, with obvious effort
at composure, &quot;What does slightly surprise me, your Highness,&mdash;if
you will allow me to say it,&mdash;is&mdash;er&mdash;your seeming
so certain of finding Monsieur Le Beau here, when your
efficient police have been searching&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Le Beau has been here for some time,&quot; put in Mouquin,
who was so nervous that he should have been elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard winced. A sombre fire flickered in Haganè&#39;s
eyes. &quot;And am I to infer that the efficient police, of
whom his Excellency so kindly speaks, have failed to keep
in touch with Monsieur&#39;s Legation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two young men crossed glances of dismay. Quickly
Haganè turned his eyes to Pierre&#39;s flushed face. Each
moist curl burned it like a scar. &quot;And similarly, I suppose,
I am mistaken in thinking that Monsieur Le Beau has
but just arrived in great haste.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before an answer could be found, footsteps and a timid
knock made interruption. Mouquin craned his neck around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[pg&nbsp;370]</span>
to the aperture of the door, altering but slightly the position
of his body.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A servant says, Excellency, that the American minister,
Mr. Todd, telephones from his Legation that he must see
you immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go, Mouquin, and stop him,&quot; said Ronsard, glibly.
&quot;Say I am out. But if he is already started wait for him
at the door, and be careful to usher him into the small drawing-room,
and keep him there till I come. Conciliate him.
Your conversation, you understand, is to be on the high C
of flippancy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the short interval Pierre had regained self-control.
&quot;Lord Haganè, in what way can I serve you?&quot; He made
a great effort to be nonchalant.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè leaned slightly toward Ronsard. &quot;Perhaps you
have heard, Excellency, that a few moments since, Monsieur
Le Beau picked up, in my humble home, quite by accident,
a private letter that I had carelessly let fall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A private letter!&quot; Ronsard turned with well-feigned
astonishment to his subordinate. &quot;Oh, no! Monsieur Le
Beau is the soul of honor!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre could not think how to weigh the naturalness of indignation
against a gentlemanly magnanimity. &quot;The prince
is mistaken,&quot; he said weakly. &quot;It must have been another
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without a flicker of anger or impatience Haganè, still
facing the count, inquired, &quot;Does the young man act with
your authority?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mon Dieu, your Highness! No. Monsieur Le Beau has a
certain official connection&mdash;but in such a <i>private</i> matter&quot;&mdash;Spread
hands and a shrug completed the thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you not at my villa this morning?&quot; Haganè had
turned suddenly to Pierre.</p>

<p class="indent">What could the Frenchman say? &quot;No,&quot; came the pliant
lie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come now, Prince Haganè!&quot; began Ronsard, genially.
&quot;You see it&#39;s all a mistake. Forgive the boy his embarrassment.
He is ill. To accuse him of purloining a private
letter! Mother of God! In France it means a duel&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[pg&nbsp;371]</span>
&quot;Not purloining, your Excellency,&quot; corrected Haganè.
&quot;Taking by accident,&mdash;quite by accident. That is different.
If our young friend was suffering from delirium he may have
forgotten. Ask him to feel in his pocket.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a damnable lie, hatched for some personal reason,&quot;
said Pierre.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè slowly rose. It was as if bronze moved. Ronsard
instinctively imitated him, watching closely. He was convinced,
now, that Haganè knew; but could not guess his next
move.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My time is valuable to-day,&quot; said the Japanese, drawling
a little. &quot;I must speak with Monsieur Le Beau alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blank silence fell on the group. Haganè looked from one
to the other, a slight shade of contempt growing in his eyes.
&quot;Is Monsieur Le Beau afraid?&quot; he asked politely. &quot;I assure
you, gentlemen, I am unarmed. Even so, he might feel safer
with a knife, a pistol. I regret that mine is at home, or I
would be pleased to lend it. Perhaps one of these gentlemen
can accommodate you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre&#39;s face was growing white in a circle about his
mouth. He stepped to Ronsard&#39;s desk, took out a revolver, a
pearl and silver toy, and slammed it on the table between
himself and Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go, your Excellency!&quot; he said, with eyes on Ronsard.
&quot;I, too, desire private speech with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pierre! Pierre! remember France,&quot; cried Count Ronsard.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè bowed to the speaker.</p>

<p class="indent">As Ronsard hesitated at the door, Mouquin pushed it
open cautiously and brought in the coffee. &quot;Not yet, Excellency,&quot;
he said. Haganè waved his refusal of a proffered
cup. Pierre poured himself three cups in succession, draining
quickly each scalding draught.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè bowed again to Ronsard. &quot;Now,&quot; he said simply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get out, Mouquin. Remember, Prince, the boy is ill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can take care of myself,&quot; Pierre said, his boyish head
thrown back.</p>

<p class="indent">Left alone the two men faced each other. Pierre leaned
with one delicate hand on the table. Nervously exalted and
chafed by silence he hurled words at his sombre opponent.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg&nbsp;372]</span>
&quot;If your time is really valuable you waste it, my Lord. I
advise you to inquire elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us be seated,&quot; said Haganè, with a pleasant smile.
Pierre, as at a physical thrust, went backward into a chair.
&quot;Now, shall we smoke?&quot; continued the other, his tone
deepening in friendliness. Its suavity had the effect of
smothering. Pierre fought it off with a rude weapon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, your Highness. Cigarettes or opium?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Do you keep the latter luxury?&quot; inquired the prince,
with interest. &quot;Have Frenchmen adopted this&mdash;vice&mdash;also?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I meant for you only,&quot; explained Pierre, foolishly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be a new-comer, unaware that I, myself, had
the drug excluded from Japan. You Christian Europeans
had already forced it on China.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre did not look up or try to answer. He felt his
every move a false one. The steadying of the coffee did
not come fast enough. He was in a hurry to get in some
telling thrust. He must defend himself and Yuki. Count
Ronsard should, after all, acknowledge him a man. The
smooth, cool tones of the other now flowed like a refreshing
liquid through his brain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I right in thinking this your first visit to Japan,
Monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, half dazed, answered, with instinctive politeness,
&quot;My first, yes. But I have for years been interested.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I venture to ask what special phase of our civilization
has been honored with your interest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre&#39;s demon nudged him. &quot;It&#39;s woman,&quot; he said,
with a short, ugly laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè&#39;s smile grew almost fatherly. &quot;In that you are
no exception to the majority of your countrymen, Monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be accurate I should have said&mdash;<i>a</i> woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The nobleman took a long whiff at his cigarette before
remarking thoughtfully, &quot;It is an unending source of wonder
to our students, Monsieur, that you of the West, even
your greatest thinkers, take women so seriously. Now with
us, apart from the one function of becoming the mothers
of our sons, they are to men as playthings to children,&mdash;as
flowers, or bright-colored birds.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[pg&nbsp;373]</span>
&quot;Am I to infer, then, that to your Highness one woman
would be about as desirable as another?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Monsieur! You are caustic. Not quite that, I protest.
There is discrimination, even in playthings. And we
must always take into account the effect of physique,&mdash;and
character,&mdash;upon possible sons.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At repetition of this sickening thought Pierre&#39;s rage gave
a convulsive bound. The veins in his temples burned the
skin. His delicate hands clenched themselves into steel.
He grasped the pistol, brandished it wildly, and putting his
face close to Haganè hissed, &quot;Leave out the name of Yuki,
and your satyr&#39;s thoughts of her, if you expect to live!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The prince&#39;s raised hand concealed an expression of amusement.
Sadness, not altogether convincing, took its place.
Pierre sank back to his chair sulkily, ashamed of his
violence.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè&#39;s eyes lowered themselves, as if in embarrassment,
to the table. He toyed with the brittle stem of a wine-glass.
&quot;It is unfortunate you are so excitable. For it was just about&mdash;Yuki&mdash;no,
never mind the pistol&mdash;that I was thinking
to take you into my confidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Le Beau stared. The prince continued thoughtfully: &quot;You
have been her friend&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>am</i> her friend!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly. I thought you ought to be told. After to-day
there will be&mdash;<i>no</i> Princess Haganè. She leaves my roof
and must publicly relinquish my name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The prince spoke blandly. Pierre&#39;s eyes seemed to protrude.
The shock of this menace counteracted the coffee.
&quot;She is innocent&mdash;&quot; He corrected himself. &quot;Why? What
has she done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè smiled pleasantly. &quot;Her innocence, as you call it,
is too dangerous. My duties, you know. She distracts me,
tires me. A mere child!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You never cared for her. You took her from me to show
your hellish power. Now you will cast her out, dishonor
her&mdash;relentlessly, for a new whim!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur should know best why I cannot trust her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A wild thought leaped like flame about Pierre&#39;s distorted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg&nbsp;374]</span>
fancy. &quot;Can you mean that she goes utterly free&mdash;free to
be happy&mdash;back to her father&#39;s home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè lowered his eyes. When he spoke his tone was
conciliatory, even regretful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Onda, being my kerai, will scarcely consent to receive
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsters! both of you. I see&mdash;I might have known.
But the Todds, thank God, are her friends!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè half lifted heavy lids. &quot;Minister Todd,&mdash;who
has signed that stolen paper,&mdash;may&mdash;er&mdash;hesitate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother of Christ! What will you have me think?
What is to be her fate? Some foul black thought still
bubbles behind those reptile eyes of yours! Out with it!
Is she to be cast forth helpless, friendless, at the mercy of
the first charitable stranger&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè lifted a hand. &quot;Now we approach reason though
by a somewhat frenzied path. You are the succoring knight.
Merely return to me, with unbroken seal, the document I saw
you take, and for reward I ask you to receive free, and untrammelled,
the person of the present Princess Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suspicion drove back into shadow a host of eager thoughts.
After one incredulous look Pierre burst into a clamor of
mirthless laughter. &quot;So it is a bribe! What fools you
must truly think all foreigners. Give the princess to me
bodily? This is melodrama. Even had I the paper and
should return it&mdash;I still deny, damn you!&mdash;you would take
powerful precaution that she did not come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you so greatly distrust your powers of attraction?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, nor her love, God bless her! But I distrust you
and your Oriental subtleties. She would come&mdash;she loves
me&mdash;but you would not let her. What guarantee can you
offer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè looked pained. &quot;No one has ever doubted my
word. But if you need it, take Japan&#39;s most sacred oath&mdash;by
the life of our Emperor! Prevent her? Oh, no. I
shall urge&mdash;compel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre struggled to preserve his balance. &quot;Even in this
barbaric country&mdash;have even&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;such power? Can
you not be called to some account?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[pg&nbsp;375]</span>
&quot;I regret the necessity of being vulgar,&quot; said Haganè, in
a composed voice, &quot;but I see I must explain. It is my&mdash;what
you call position&mdash;my&mdash;er&mdash;rank. It might not
be possible to every Japanese, Monsieur. But as things
are, the woman is as much mine as a French spaniel would
be yours. Again I assure you, by the life of my Emperor,
she will come. Again I ask, Do you accept my bargain?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre whispered to himself Count Ronsard&#39;s words, &quot;Remember
France!&quot; He tried to keep his reason, but the wave
of hope had surged high. He saw as in a vision Yuki, disgraced,
rejected, wandering alone through the wind-swept
streets. He saw her face sheltered upon his arm,&mdash;that
little face so pure, so delicate, so well-beloved. Her desolation
touched him for a moment with an unselfish grief.
&quot;She is proud&mdash;she is brave!&quot; he cried aloud. &quot;Even at
your orders will she come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so, Monsieur. She might possibly consider it a
last chance to serve the country she has wronged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and she might prefer to die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè sent a curious, cold look to search the young man&#39;s
thought. &quot;Do Christians dare&mdash;to die?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The acid scorn bit deep. &quot;Yes,&quot; raved Pierre. &quot;And they
dare to live, and, sometimes, they dare to slay! I do not
consent, remember. I believe it yet to be a trick, a mockery.
If I find it so, I swear in the name of that Christian God
whom you blaspheme&mdash;if I find that you are holding out
the one bribe that you know I would sell my soul to the
devil for&mdash;thinking to gloat over the new deviltry of
snatching it away&mdash;I&#39;ll&mdash;I&#39;ll&mdash;&quot; He broke off, mouthing
for words that would not come.</p>

<p class="indent">His hand unconsciously fingered the cold surface of the
pistol. Again Haganè looked bored, and made a gesture of
distaste.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t sneer like that, you toad of hell!&quot; shrieked his
companion. &quot;You think this bluster,&mdash;but I mean it. I
mean it terribly!&quot; A sudden sound in the outer hall cut
short the threat. Footsteps, in stockinged feet, or in the
Japanese tabi, came swiftly. Both men by instinct fixed
eyes upon the door.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg&nbsp;376]</span>
Yuki walked straight to her husband and stood still. Their
eyes met. &quot;I thank the Gods that you are safe,&quot; she said
aloud. Her glance moved quickly to Pierre, surprising on
his face a hurt, incredulous expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur, be comforted. It is for the country, not for
me,&quot; mocked Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, Madame,&quot; he said, with bloodshot eyes on
Yuki, &quot;have you explanation for this new act of disobedience,
of affront to my dignity?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki did not hasten to reply. Whether the power had
grown from without or within that childish form, a new
strength was now hers. She had the look of one who, after
long wandering in a dangerous forest, has spied a path.</p>

<p class="indent">The gray robe, hastily caught back to decorous lines, showed
traces of rough handling. Over her head she had thrown a
light wrap called a dzukin. It hid her forehead with a nun-like
band, was crossed under the chin, and knotted loosely
behind the head. Not a strand of hair emerged. Her face,
in the dull silver setting, gleamed like a long white pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè observed the change in her. The repulsion left
his eyes. He waited in patience, and with some curiosity,
for her answer. &quot;I came, your Highness,&quot; she vouchsafed
at length, &quot;because without me you cannot get the paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè&#39;s eyes went instantly to Pierre.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki, for God&#39;s sake are you mad?&quot; cried the Frenchman.
&quot;I know of no paper. I have assured him that I do
not know of it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give him the paper, Pierre,&quot; said the girl, gently.
&quot;Through me it was lost, and if I am to have a human
soul hereafter&mdash;give him the paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè sucked in bitter triumph from Pierre&#39;s discomfiture.
His eyes crucified the boyish face. Like a brood
of dark vultures his conjectures swooped down to the cowering
prey. Yet before Yuki&#39;s entrance he had, for a moment,
felt talons at his own breast. Instinctively Pierre
had clutched at his coat, where the document lay concealed.
Haganè said softly, &quot;Perhaps it is as well, Madame, that
you have disobeyed. Yet on your lover&#39;s countenance I
do not observe signs of joyous welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[pg&nbsp;377]</span>
&quot;I came looking for no welcome, Lord, nor has personal
desire directed me. I have done great wrong. Again has
my weakness proved my enemy. But a hope of partial
atonement has not gone altogether from me.&quot; She stretched
both hands to Pierre. &quot;Pierre, if you have known love,
give me the paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not understand,&quot; stammered Pierre. &quot;Are you
against me for that man? Here is the chance of our revenge,&mdash;our
passport to happiness. I have not harmed him otherwise.
Would you take this one possible chance from me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not against you, Pierre. I am not for Haganè. It
is myself, my wretched, shivering self, for which I plead.
No, you cannot understand. I am Japanese. I must regain
the paper. Through my cowardice you won it. At any
sacrifice you can name I must get it back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè saw how she labored to keep her voice gentle and
soothing. She had the accents of a suffering mother who
tries to coax a sick child. The husband saw more in the
calm, ashen face. &quot;You have yet patriotism,&quot; he said, so
low that she alone heard.</p>

<p class="indent">To these words she gave no recognition. She watched the
Frenchman as Haganè studied her. The folds of her dzukin,
heaped high and light about the slim throat, stifled her. She
tugged nervously at it until one end came loose and fell. By
inches the flexible fabric crawled down from hair to shoulder,
then down her body to the floor. The disorder of the thick
hair, one blue-black lock almost hiding her left temple and
streaming to her breast, gave her an unfamiliar, a weird,
even a supernatural appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè still held a cigarette in the death-mask of his face.
He took it out now carefully. &quot;You speak of revenge, Monsieur,
meaning, of course, the personal revenge. Europeans
conceive all offences to be personal. You weaklings
have your code,&mdash;your jumping-jack ethics. Something
touches a spring, and your honor leaps up and crows. You
could hardly understand the language we now speak, though
our words were purest French. I will attempt to elucidate.
This woman refers to an&mdash;essence&mdash;underlying all personalities
and all time. It is a stratum of substance which boils
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg&nbsp;378]</span>
and seethes in our sun, which sets the planets swinging in
their steady paths, which ebbs and flows, a thin, resistless tide,
down through the world of ghosts. We call it &#39;En.&#39; You
have no better word, I think, than &#39;Necessity.&#39; This woman
had a trust and failed. Sometimes the sabre slash of fatal
weakness lays bare a hidden source of strength. I believe
it to be so with her. The gods have smiled a ritual of
sacrifice! No,&mdash;you do not understand. If I sang an obscene
song your eyes would sparkle,&mdash;now they are bits of
dull blue clay.&mdash;Onda Yuki-ko!&quot; he said in another tone,
and with a voice slightly raised, &quot;have you the thought
that, in winning back for your land this stolen document,
you become worthy again to be my wife,&mdash;to bear my
name?&quot; Yuki&#39;s head went up a little. If Death himself
could smile he would perhaps own the gleam which for
an instant lighted her dark eyes. &quot;Lord, we agree that I
have failed. There is no deeper degradation. As for resuming
your name,&mdash;you should have understood, before
this, that I shall not need it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre wrinkled his forehead. The three stood. Pierre
leaned against the edge of a massive table, and sometimes
steadied himself with hands upon it. He bore upon the
oaken surface now. The drift of their conversation, though
in careful English, was indeed beyond him. Haganè did not
menace Yuki. In her look toward him was no hint of fear.
Yet between them, across from each to each, in all the space
around them, the spider&mdash;tragedy&mdash;hurried unceasingly,
and wove a closing web. They stared out from the black net
with faces of calm nobility. An influence shook the Frenchman,
vibrated through the particles of his brain, shrank
and inflated his soul in its clay vessel. In bewilderment, as
one reaches out in the dark, his voice cried, &quot;Is this your
sorrow, Yuki? Do you wish still to be his? If you bid
me, perhaps I too can sacrifice. Shall I buy his mercy for
you with this paper?&quot; He snatched it out, but instead of
presenting it, held the white rectangle again against his
breast. The seal glared and winked like the inflamed eye
of a pygmy Cyclops.</p>

<p class="indent">This was Pierre&#39;s supremest moment. Never again did he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[pg&nbsp;379]</span>
reach an equal height. The altitude turned him cold and
dizzy. Blood surged in his ears, and tears of self-appreciation,
of self-pity, sponged with a misty blur the room and
its occupants.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, catching her underlip between her teeth, and bruising
her slim hands together for control, went nearer. &quot;Pierre,
I thank you. I shall never forget this greatness,&mdash;in another
world or this. You do much to restore what you, too, have
lost. But I cannot bid you sacrifice. Haganè would not take
the paper at that price. I myself must find a way to win it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè sat like a mass of clay new fallen from a cliff.
Yuki&#39;s voice trailed off. An angelic sweetness hung about
the echoes.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the clay was troubled. It stirred heavily. Haganè
rose with his usual massive deliberation. &quot;Tell her, Frenchman,
the price I had already offered you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not do it with that pure face before me, Haganè.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè bowed. No hint of sarcasm cheapened the salutation.
&quot;Then, Yuki, I must speak it. I offered him in exchange
for the paper your fair, white body to be his, as a
dog is his, as a snatched blossom. That was my bargain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant she swayed and leaned one hand on the table
opposite from Pierre. Haganè placed a chair for her. Before
sinking to it she spoke, her eyes set on her husband, her
voice grave and contained. &quot;Then, Lord Haganè, you have
revealed a depth of degradation below the uttermost punishment
which I should have thought you willing to bestow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Also,&quot; continued Haganè, &quot;I ventured to declare, and
to believe, that you would go to him willingly.&quot; Pierre
quivered under this insult to the woman he loved. But
Yuki did not look ashamed. Pushing back the hair from
both temples she bent her eyes upward, as though invoking
strength from unseen powers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Yuki, darling,&quot; cried Pierre, coming to her. &quot;He
will free you honorably. You shall be mine forever, and
we shall soon forget these horrors of the past. I will
give him the paper if you wish it. What do I care for
Ronsard or for France if I, with this, can buy your life-long
happiness?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg&nbsp;380]</span>
Yuki shivered in all the length of her limbs. Haganè
turned away. His face could not be seen with the utterance
of his next words. Curiously enough they sounded
apologetic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was the only way I saw, Yuki, the only bribe that
such a man might take. Your body, soiled already, have I
offered. Do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre&#39;s gaze, too, had fallen. Shame weighed all lids.
An abnormal silence came to the little group. Yuki broke
it with a long, long breath, as of relief and comprehension.
The men looked toward her. Haganè clenched a brown fist
to a cluster of throbbing veins. But the Frenchman gaped,
incredulous, and gaped again. For Yuki was smiling at
something far away. A light already not of earth lay on
her waxen brow. &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Yes, now, at
last, I understand. You will not force the gift, Haganè.
It must be mine. Why, Pierre, look not so strange because,
at last, I understand. You cannot know yet, poor Pierre,
but soon you will know too. I must be yours, of course.
Have you not planned, and spied, and&mdash;stolen for this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki,&quot; said Haganè, in a deeply troubled voice, &quot;if Monsieur
Le Beau by any chance should give the paper&mdash;unconditionally
should refuse the price&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! no!&quot; she cried, with a quick note of terror, and
sprang to her feet again. &quot;Where would be my atonement,
my reparation? Think it not, Lord. See that your great
mercy be not merciless. I shall go, gladly, gladly, to Monsieur
Le Beau; my heart falters not for myself,&mdash;but him.
It is a cruel deed to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And well deserved,&quot; muttered Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Being myself weak, Lord,&quot; said the young wife, &quot;I feel
that the deserving is, after all, the hardest pang.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre dashed his hand across his brow, and went to a small
sideboard for a liqueur. Again these strange people were talking
their mystic gibberish. Yuki was more clear, indeed.
She had stated openly to her husband that she wished to
be given to another man. Neither seemed to feel the least
delicacy or shame. In Pierre&#39;s fastidious thought this fact
made a tiny stain for Yuki. The old brute evidently wanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[pg&nbsp;381]</span>
to be rid of her, and she, eagerly accepting freedom, did not
shrink from claiming at once a more desirable companionship.
At the last moment should he, Pierre, refuse to
grasp the prize he had turned criminal in pursuing? No, a
thousand times no! Yuki&#39;s friendless condition demanded
his deepest pity. It was with a faint touch of condescension
that he leaned to her, saying, &quot;Do not falter now, Yuki. Our
goal is in sight. I will be true to you. I will yet make you
happy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Happy! happy!&quot; echoed the woman in a ghost&#39;s voice.
&quot;All foreigners think and say only that one thing,&mdash;<i>happy</i>!
Pierre, Pierre, I need so much more than&mdash;happiness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The pathos of her voice, her small face, touched him to a
manlier emotion. She was so young, so white, so helpless!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What it is possible for me to give you I live but to
bestow, my darling,&quot; he said, and, kneeling, kissed a small,
scarred hand. &quot;I can promise love, protection, deep respect,&mdash;for
the slime of this man shall not cling to you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè snatched him bodily from the floor. His eyes
blazed like a beast&#39;s. &quot;Time will come for puling. A few
things are yet to be said. Let us conclude the savory bargain.
I must be gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, let us finish quickly,&quot; whispered Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gallant lover,&quot; continued Haganè to Pierre, &quot;when and
how do you wish to claim your prize?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, at once,&quot; cried Pierre, rallying a little under the
scorn hurled toward him. &quot;You have the eyes of a demon.
She would not be safe alone with you. Take the paper now,
and let me have her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki shivered again, and hid her face in her sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not harm madame. This I can assure you. But
the earliest possible hour for your ecstasy will be&mdash;to-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-night&mdash;to-night!&quot; moaned Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be so. You cannot pass another night beneath
my roof, and there is none who dares receive you but this
brawny champion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-night! It is an eternity away!&quot; cried Pierre. &quot;See,
love, the sun already is low. I hear the moat-crows cawing.
To-night we shall begin to live!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[pg&nbsp;382]</span>
&quot;Kwannon Sama&mdash;oh, dear Saviour, help me to endure,&quot;
said Yuki to herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow I join the army in Manchuria. Whatever is
to do must be completed before the dawn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-night! To-night, this very night!&quot; sang Pierre, like
a schoolboy. &quot;They called me sick, but I am already a
well man! That was a marvellous draught you gave me in
the tea-rooms, Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time Haganè showed a puzzled frown. Yuki
explained quickly. &quot;Oh, I had forgotten that you did not
know. Pierre wandered delirious into our garden this forenoon,
your Highness, just after your instructions to me. I
could think of no way to send him off, so I took him to the
Cha no yu rooms and gave him a fever mixture and a sleeping-draught.
I believed he would remain asleep until after the
meeting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I didn&#39;t,&quot; laughed Pierre. &quot;It must have been the
God of Good Luck that woke me when he did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tried to tell your Highness before the meeting, although
you had given me orders not to disturb your mind,&quot; went on
Yuki to her husband in the same quiet way. &quot;Perhaps you
will recall my effort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do,&quot; said Haganè. &quot;It goes far to exonerate you. Tell
me more in detail.&quot; Yuki closed her lips. She did not wish
to be exonerated, at least by Haganè. This was her one
supreme opportunity for full expiation,&mdash;for sacrifice. No
one should wrest it from her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I woke in good time,&quot; babbled Pierre, to whose brain the
liquor was giving a strange lightness. &quot;I saw the statesmen
come and go. They whispered and leaned down. I saw
Todd, and Sir Charles,&mdash;and Yuki by the window. I saw
my Lord Haganè come to her with the great paper in his
hand. She was going to betray poor Pierre to him, but
first the great lord must have his say. He told her of the
paper&mdash;and then he made iron love&mdash;that old lord. I
could hear his joints rasp. &#39;Yuki, you are my wife! When
this time of stress and strain is over I shall teach you
something of a brighter hue than duty!&#39; Ah, ha! making
love, like any schoolboy! She never kissed you as she has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>[pg&nbsp;383]</span>
kissed me, Haganè. Oh, she cared for me in the little tearooms.
We played we were married. Go there; you will
find the cushions, the trinkets strewn around, the broken
hairpin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A dull purple tide rushed upward to Haganè&#39;s face and
stayed there. No battle-wounds could sting and torture
like the mincing mimicry of the Frenchman&#39;s words. His
control was superhuman. He leaned an instant nearer the
fireplace to flip off a cigarette ash, then faced his companions
coolly. &quot;I must remember to investigate the scene of
romance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki bowed. If she had craved martyrdom, here were assuring
circumstances. Pierre&#39;s thoughtless words, Haganè&#39;s
passionate calm, were prison manacles. They snapped on
wrists already scarred. She welcomed the cold compulsion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; Pierre hurried on, &quot;let us get back to business.
To-night, you say? I agree, but where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Should the noble count permit such base use of it, the
most suitable spot would be your Legation,&quot; said Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre gave a hiss. His head was on fire again. He
must hurry and have things settled before the full conflagration
came. &quot;More melodrama! I feel the sincerity
of your suggestion. Shall I summon the noble count to be
asked?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. I shall await him here. Kindly hasten, as
the day already wanes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre fell back a little, half in derision, half in apprehensive
credulity, like a harlequin in two shades.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really mean it! Well, I shall go. I will get him if
he is to be brought. He must come,&mdash;I shall be in need of
him. It is all a dream, a fever dream. Will you give parole
to stay here till I come back,&mdash;you and Yuki?&quot; His bright
eyes shot suspiciously from one to the other. There was still
so much he did not understand.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè sighed. He assumed the expression of one who
has had an insect light upon him and whose dignity forbids
him to brush it off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Answer the Frenchman, Yuki-ko.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will remain, Monsieur Le Beau,&quot; said Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[pg&nbsp;384]</span>
Left alone, the husband and wife instinctively drew nearer.
After gazing for a long moment Haganè suddenly put out
his hands. Yuki thrust hers within them and lifted wide
eyes. Her face had a look of blurred moonlight. Out of the
mystic whiteness her eyes gleamed like deep spiritual wells,
where hopes and possibilities, already death-shadowed, drifted
in a spectral sheen. Haganè tightened his clasp, and at the
same instant let his own soul come full into his face. Yuki
shivered. Her lips parted. Virtue flowed in upon her from
his touch. She thought, as in a vision, of the Kioto statue
worn smooth by the touch of dying men. What ghostly comfort
that image could have held was but a feeble emanation
beside the blinding power of this living god.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All things are not yet clear to me,&quot; said the man.
&quot;Something is hidden, and you jealously conceal the hiding-place.
Yet you sheltered that spy. You prevented me from
following. Speak your whole heart, Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I have a secret, Lord, it is one which aids to purify
and consecrate my sacrifice. I long for that sweet hour,
Lord. My parched spirit strains toward it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè&#39;s lips twitched once. &quot;Yuki, as to the ear of
your ancestral gods, tell me, should this paper be regained
by means less terrible,&mdash;are you worthy to be my wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thinking of her weakness, her great and not ignoble
efforts doomed always, it would seem, to failure, and with
the knowledge of this man&#39;s greatness full upon her, Yuki
answered simply, &quot;No.&quot; Her very innocence betrayed her
and sealed the doom of death.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè had a man&#39;s thoughts. Pierre&#39;s boast&mdash;the disordered
rooms of the tea-house&mdash;the broken hairpin&mdash;lashed
him with a fiery hail. He groaned and dropped his
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki, Yuki!&quot; came a voice as though from a mangled
soul. &quot;Did you not begin to feel it? I love you! From
that first instant in Washington&mdash;I have loved you
more dearly than I ought. The Gods punish me for my
infatuation!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s cheeks grew faintly tinged. &quot;Once, nay, twice,
Lord, my heart bespoke it, but I dared not listen. If a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[pg&nbsp;385]</span>
star had slid through the night to my hand, I would sooner
believe that I dreamed, awake, than that the heavens had
lost a star.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A soul&mdash;a face&mdash;a heart like thine, Yuki&mdash;to be
befouled by a Frenchman&#39;s love!&quot; he cried in agony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Lord,&quot; whispered the girl, &quot;perhaps by suffering
greatly in this life&mdash;perhaps in my completeness of expiation&mdash;I
shall, in the next life, be near thee!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè could only groan. The black spider busied itself
about them. A strange stillness fell on Yuki. She put up
a hand to her husband&#39;s shoulder, drawing him closer. &quot;My
soul is like a quiet pool, my husband. Gaze in, softly, and
see your own face there. Nay, break not the shining by
thy tears. You must help me to suffer greatly. Let no
interference come. This last treachery to the weak boy
who has loved me is part of the pain. He will forgive
me and forget. He will even be happier than for me to
live on as your wife&mdash;your loved wife! That is too heavenly
a thing for one so frail as I. Let me die, Lord, as you and
I, though without speech, have agreed upon. At last I shall
serve. Will you promise to befriend me to that hour, my
husband?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To that hour and beyond!&quot; groaned Haganè. A moment
after, he said, &quot;Do you realize, my Yuki, what may be the
power of a soul freed like yours,&mdash;shot suddenly from the
bowstring of a fixed purpose? It is a thunderbolt of the Gods!
Not only in your body&#39;s death, but through your free soul,
after, shall you aid Nippon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The wonder in her wide gaze grew. A dawn, it spread
circling to outer rims of darkness. Currents of unseen force
seemed to whirl in the air about them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Soul of my Yuki, I shall summon you to fields of death.
Stand near me in perplexing hours, cleave to him who is
to be thy mate in a nobler rebirth! Breathe your power
through me in moments of despair, lift up your voice when
a thousand guns roar death, when ghosts spring up like
flames, and the commander sobs to hear the cry of &#39;Victory!&#39;
So shall you be worthy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord! Lord! Already art thou a God, and I thy chosen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[pg&nbsp;386]</span>
comrade! Wield my freed spirit to our country&#39;s need! At
last I shall be strong. Into thy hands&mdash;Lord&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Things of the flesh flared up and blew back forever, like
scraps of burnt moor-grass. The white flint of her soul had
struck from him its spark of immortality!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[pg&nbsp;387]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Pierre&#39;s</span> visible return was preceded by a great chatter of
his voice, now in English, again in French. Evidently he had
more than one companion. Haganè and Yuki drew apart.
Pierre stood at the door which, with a wide French gesture, he
had flung open. The tall figure of Minister Todd entered,
followed closely by Count Ronsard. It was the latter who
saw to the careful closing of the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Todd!&quot; Yuki faltered, under her breath. Here was
a new and terrible trial. Haganè gave her a glance. He saw
her slight figure stiffen, and her face grow still again. The
light upon his stern countenance was almost as beautiful as
her own.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre began a hurried and vaporous explanation. &quot;Mr.
Todd was here, your Highness, as you were already aware.
He desired greatly to come, and his Excellency, the count,
wished it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Entirely unofficial,&quot; Ronsard hastened to add. &quot;It is a
personal misunderstanding, nothing more. I have been assuring
Mr. Todd that it is utterly unofficial!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd raised his thin hand. Reassurance had already come
to him. Yuki was safe, and Haganè had the look of an altarpiece.
No personal harm, at least, was to be done. &quot;Before
this goes one step further I want to say for myself, that unless
Prince Haganè is quite willing to have me, I leave at once. I
don&#39;t pretend to understand what has happened, but I have
full faith in Yuki and her husband. There, your Highness!
I am through with my little stunt. Shall I strike roots, or
reverse the throttle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unless against the wishes of Madame la Princesse, I desire
you to remain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame la Princesse!&quot; mocked Pierre, angrily, under his
breath.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[pg&nbsp;388]</span>
Yuki&#39;s dignity equalled that of her husband. &quot;Kindly
remain, Mr. Todd,&quot; she murmured, with a slight bow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Highness,&quot; said Todd, still addressing Haganè,
&quot;now tell us how many grains of wheat are in this chaff of
foolishness Pierre is giving us! Something about your going
to send my little Yuki off like a piece of broken china, for
him, Le Beau, to patch together at his leisure. Pshaw! Of
course the boy is out of his head!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè thought deeply before he made reply. His sobriety
and deliberation gave unusual weight to speech always impressive.
Each word was a nail driven straight into the lid of
an abandoned hope.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame la Princesse has offended in a way peculiarly
Japanese,&mdash;difficult, I think,&mdash;too difficult even for your
sympathy and kindness to comprehend. There is no need to
dwell upon it. She leaves me of her own free will. She and
I understand each other perfectly. That is all! We shall
detain you two gentlemen but a moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Entirely unofficial, your Excellency will observe,&quot; whispered
Ronsard, nervously, to the American.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, I made that much out for myself,&quot; said Todd to
Haganè. &quot;If you intend to separate, it is deplorable, but
clearly none of my business. It&#39;s the other heinous suggestion,
that of handing her over to another man, that makes
me hot in the collar. Don&#39;t tell me I must believe this of
your Highness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Neither Haganè&#39;s eyes nor voice faltered. &quot;The man,
Monsieur Le Beau, has a service to perform for Japan. He
asks a certain price. Yuki alone can pay that price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is simple enough, Mr. Todd,&quot; Pierre burst in. The
discussion went in a direction distasteful to him. He did not
wish the matter of the paper, and its means of acquirement,
laid bare. &quot;I can do the prince a service. For it, Yuki
becomes my own, as from the beginning she should have been.
This little talisman merely rights the mistakes of Fortune.&quot;
He held out the document, shaking it to attract attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The very paper I helped to sign, this day!&quot; said Todd,
wondering. &quot;What, in the name of Beelzebub, are you doing
with it? Haganè was to guard it with his life! There&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[pg&nbsp;389]</span>
something queer in this. I smell foul play! Did Yuki,&mdash;could
Yuki have&mdash;?&quot; He checked himself, reddening at the
baseness of his quick suspicion. Yuki, facing him, gave no
answering flush. She was white,&mdash;white beyond belief in a
thing that lived at all. Her low voice gave each syllable full
measure. &quot;I was partly&mdash;to blame&mdash;that Monsieur Le
Beau secured that paper. I shall pay his price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd&#39;s eyes still hung on her, fascinated, incredulous. He
could not believe her capable of vileness. He knew that no
depth of personal degradation could begin to compare, in the
Japanese mind, with an offence against loyalty. It was to
them, truly, the sin against the Holy Ghost. Yet, by her own
words, Yuki was condemned. His stung thought flashed to
Pierre, and fastened on him. &quot;Then, man, it is a double
wrong! I do not know yet how you got the thing; but if
she is implicated, you owe it to her, far more than yourself,
to be decent! In the name of morality,&mdash;of honor,&mdash;do not
sell the thing; give it back without condition! Your proposition
is damnable!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His Excellency Mr. Todd was one who signed the paper;
he pleads for its return,&quot; murmured Ronsard to the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind that!&quot; flashed Todd. &quot;The paper doesn&#39;t
trouble me a little bit! I am thinking of Yuki!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;Mr. Todd&mdash;Yuki, she wish to pay that price.
She wish to be given&mdash;so&mdash;to Monsieur!&quot; said the Princess
Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre flashed a look of triumph into Todd&#39;s dazed eyes.
Defiantly he went to Yuki, caught her hand, and kissed it.
&quot;You see and hear her for yourself!&quot; vaunted Pierre. Todd
appealed dumbly to Haganè for extrication from this amazing
skein of tangled interests. Haganè brooded on his wife with
tenderness,&mdash;with the ache of love,&mdash;as over a dying child.
Yuki drew her hand from Pierre and went to the minister.
&quot;Don&#39;t try to understand,&quot; she urged him, piteously, &quot;don&#39;t
defend me! You cannot understand,&mdash;not even Gwendolen
could understand!&quot; She caught her breath sharply,
with a new and untried pang, &quot;Oh, Gwendolen, my dear
one!&quot; she moaned, &quot;I had forgotten you. Gwendolen&mdash;Gwendolen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>[pg&nbsp;390]</span>
&quot;If I might be allowed to say a word in behalf of France,&quot;
ventured Ronsard, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Excellency,&quot; interrupted Pierre, &quot;let us have no
further discussion. I cannot be interfered with, even by you.
The thing is done! I have agreed! Prince Haganè protects
us all! All are satisfied. Cela!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; echoed Yuki. &quot;Everything is settled!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s one thing that isn&#39;t!&quot; flared out Todd. &quot;I say to
you men, French and Japanese alike, damn you for a set of
cold-blooded, fanatical politicians! Out of the bunch I respect&mdash;no,
I despise a little less, Le Beau, for though an egoist and
a fool, he is at least on fire with love. As for you two statesmen,
there&#39;s something rotten in your refrigerators! I know
what Le Beau has to sell, of course; and it is not worth the
sacrifice of this poor shivering child! Ronsard, speak up for
France, without permission or apology. Where is your honor,
where that little cross with the red ribbon, that you stand by
and see this wedge of opportunity driven by a boy&#39;s lust into
sand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Excellency!&quot; thundered Haganè. &quot;Though you
signed the paper, it is not yours. I claim it&mdash;for Nippon!
I alone am responsible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki cowered an instant, pressing both hands against her
ears, then she rallied, and crying, &quot;Do not interfere,&mdash;it is
Haganè&#39;s concern and mine,&quot; went up to Todd, and seized his
arm for emphasis. He pushed her off. &quot;It may be Haganè&#39;s
business, but I make it mine! God! These are not the Dark
Ages. I&#39;m not the man to stand aside and have a woman
burned at the stake of political exigency. I&#39;ll turn traitor myself!
I&#39;ll tell the purport of the paper! I&#39;ll wire my resignation
to Washington next day! But I won&#39;t keep still!&quot; His
lean figure flashed with indignation like a gleam that plays
along an unsheathed sword.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki, wheeling back to him with incredible swiftness, caught
down the upraised hand, and strained it to her breast. She
threw herself against him, praying, it would seem, for eternal
life. &quot;Oh, my friend, you are noble, but you make the terrible
mistake! You will kill my soul, which has but just
come alive. Let me go to Pierre, as is now planned. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[pg&nbsp;391]</span>
think, maybe, that I do some great sacrifice for my country,
like that good girl, Jeanne d&#39;Arc. But you think too high.
I am bad! I am the cat! I have no love for Nippon or for
Haganè! No, I have the one wish now,&mdash;to go to Pierre&mdash;to
Pierre! I was close to him a moment, and now you come
to drag me away. Keep me not from Pierre!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd scrutinized her from between stiffening, half-closed eyelids.
The gathering corner-wrinkles had the effect of sparks.
&quot;It&#39;s no good, Yuki!&quot; he said quietly. &quot;It don&#39;t work a little
bit! I&#39;ve known you too long!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but I <i>is</i> bad, very bad! You didn&#39;t know, of course
not! I was sly to hide everythings. Pierre and I have
arrange so that, in spite of cruel father, and Prince Haganè
and all, we comes together at last! Ah, push me off again!&quot;
she cried convulsively. &quot;That is right! I care not if I lose
you, and Mrs. Todd, and Gwendolen, and my good name,&mdash;everything!
if only I can go to Pierre this night! Just let
me do what I wish, as all have agree but you. Try not to
prevent!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the wild light in her eyes, the impassioned ring of her
voice, Todd, his faith for the moment quailing, had pushed her
off a few shuddering inches. She clung still to his hand. By
this he drew her near again, and probed. Before his first
word, she must have surmised the change, for she swayed in
his hold, shuddered violently, closed her lids, and let her lips
form a few dumb words of prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki!&quot; Todd began, in a voice so low that the others
scarcely heard. &quot;Yuki, this is a part you are playing. Eternity
is your stage, and tragedy your curtain. The room
smells of it. You are not bad. You harbor now a heroic
design. I cannot understand, but I believe it to be supreme!
Before God, look into my eyes, and tell me the truth. I will
not betray you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted calmly, now, the great, dark orbs. He gazed
down into them, to the thought that lay, like a white rock, in
the clear depths. In absolute moments the human soul has a
speech of its own and an ear to listen. Her lips moved no
more. She was not conscious of further effort to make him
see. Without grosser statement, knowledge came to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>[pg&nbsp;392]</span>
This life of earth already had lost its hold on her,&mdash;Pierre
was less than a shadow on a stream. Todd knew that she
was to die,&mdash;that the discarded shell of the thing he loved
would be Pierre&#39;s prize. By the same ghostly prescience
Haganè knew that certainty had laid her cold touch upon the
American. He averted quickly his dark face from the sight.
Ronsard, who was nearest, saw a mighty shudder blow upon
him; then the face, now twitching, lifted toward the light.
His lips moved. Ronsard could not surmise the trend of the
broken, muttered words; but Yuki, who had neither heard nor
seen, knew that he was praying.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd loosed the girl&#39;s hand now, not in rebuke, but as one
incapable of sustaining longer the fragile burden. The alertness,
the eagerness went from him. All at once he was a
middle-aged man. &quot;And I must stand by and do&mdash;nothing!&quot;
he whispered, half to himself, half to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you can still do much. You can believe in me,&mdash;and
Gwendolen will not need to scorn me. I will thank you
always, if only for what you have just understood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come!&quot; said Haganè, sharply. &quot;A woman&#39;s endurance
has a limit. The paper, please, Monsieur Le Beau.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard touched Pierre&#39;s arm. &quot;Not until you have received
your price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When Yuki comes to me to-night, and not before,&quot; said
Pierre, valiantly. He was pleased with the sound of his own
bravado.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki threw a piteous glance toward her husband. &quot;Then
shall I accompany, now? I think I can do all, alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè did not answer her. He held Pierre in a hard gaze.
&quot;To-night?&quot; he questioned. &quot;How can I be sure that the
seal will be intact?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir!&quot; said Pierre, indignantly, &quot;your suggestion is an
insult!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! do thieves who enter other men&#39;s homes to rob them
still wave the flag of honor?&quot; Pierre drew back, flushed and
scowling, with a muttered curse. Todd gave a great start. It
was the first time he had heard the specific charge. How
then, if Pierre were a mere common thief, could Yuki be
involved? Again he was baffled. He shook his head sadly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>[pg&nbsp;393]</span>
and kept silence. Haganè had begun to speak again. &quot;I am
willing to refer the matter to arbitration, but shall not consent
to the document remaining here. Let it be put into the
hands of a third party, until to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Yuki, eagerly. &quot;Mr. Todd will keep it. All
trust him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre and Ronsard exchanged apprehensive glances. To
refuse was impossible. &quot;An&mdash;an&mdash;excellent plan,&quot; said
Ronsard, with a watery beam. &quot;But, since Russia is our
ally&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Utterly unofficial, you know. A purely personal misunderstanding,&quot;
reminded Todd, not without a gleam of
malice. &quot;In your present attitude, Count Ronsard, you can
scarcely claim anything further. France&#39;s honor hardly rests
on&mdash;felony! I am willing to hold it; and, if the prince
should fail to drive in the sacrificial lamb, otherwise Yuki,
France gets the paper, I presume.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Haganè, and Ronsard in a breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only,&quot; interpolated Yuki, in her low, clear voice, &quot;no
sacrificial lamb is to be driven, your Excellency,&mdash;only a
woman gaining her soul&#39;s desire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre triumphed in glances about the room. Couldn&#39;t
the fool American see that Yuki was simply dying to get
away from old Haganè and come to him! Why this continued
talk of sacrifice? It sounded like the Japanese themselves.
Pierre sent an ardent, encouraging look to the girl. To his
surprise, her face was set steadily upon Haganè, and in his
answering gaze was the same embarrassing rapture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Todd, sharply, &quot;am I to keep the paper or not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear colleague,&quot; stuttered Ronsard, paddling the air
with gestures of concession, &quot;of course, in your keeping it is
as safe as&mdash;say&mdash;in my private desk. Pierre!&mdash;&quot; There
was a sharp tang to the name.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man reluctantly handed the envelope to Todd.
He took it with a crooked smile. Haganè and Yuki remained
calm as statues.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame,&quot; the host said, with fictitious gayety, &quot;perhaps,
as a matter of delicacy, congratulations are not in order; yet
allow me to assure you of my good-will and homage!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[pg&nbsp;394]</span>
Yuki met his look. Her face was still expressionless, like
a Japanese painting of a high-born lady where repose is the
desired essential. Something underlying the white calm
disturbed him. After her few gentle words, &quot;I thank your
Excellency,&quot; he was glad to turn away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-night at eight,&quot; said Haganè, moving toward the door.
&quot;Can all be present at eight?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The three men bowed gravely. Ronsard for once had forgotten
etiquette. He was allowing his visitors to leave alone.
Yuki, with no further look for Pierre, prepared to follow her
husband, but Todd came to himself with a queer, choking
little sound. In two long strides he overtook her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki,&mdash;how can. I stand it? You are like my other
child! I am in a bed of nettles, and you have tied my hands!
I have agreed to take this paper chiefly on the hope that I may
stir Le Beau to a nobler issue. You must agree,&mdash;you <i>must</i>&mdash;to
a less awful price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki&#39;s lifted face was whiter now than any death, but somehow,
under the icy surface a flower was frozen. &quot;Pierre will
not agree, because I have said I wish to go to him. You have
understood the Japanese heart strangely; but even yet,&mdash;there
are spaces you have not dreamed. I pray God for you
to fail, dear Mr. Todd, but I ask his blessing on your kindness.
Give to those dear ones at your home, my Sayonara, and my
undying love!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd writhed as if stung by an unseen serpent. &quot;And yet,
within my bounds of confidence and honor, I must reason
with Pierre, must speak more fully with Ronsard!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I trust you utterly,&quot; said Yuki, as she faded through the
doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard, recalled perhaps by the mention of his name,
hurried forward now, and accompanied the noble guests to the
portico. Left together, Pierre and Todd eyed each other.
On the younger, more beautiful face, vanity and self-satisfaction
were spread as scented unguents. The hour was his.
He had triumphed! Yuki, in spite of all these grave men,
was to be his own. Oh, he would make her happy!</p>

<p class="indent">It is said that the colorless color &#39;white&#39; is merely a cunning
admixture of all hues. In the same way, the iridescent struggle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[pg&nbsp;395]</span>
of contempt, pity, incredulity, disapprobation, whirling
together in the American&#39;s mind, coalesced into blankness,&mdash;the
consciousness of a situation hopeless, irremediable.
Without a word or exclamation he sank to the nearest chair,
put his long, lean arms out upon the table, and laid his face
upon them. So the two men remained, until the heavy footsteps
of Ronsard came back into the hall,&mdash;until he entered,
and, casting an eye on the prostrate form, asked of Pierre, in
a whisper, &quot;Is his Excellency ill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Pierre, irritably. &quot;He is not, but I am. Nobody
seems to think of the strain I&#39;ve been under all this
time. With your permission, Excellency, I&#39;ll have one of
the servants telephone for a physician. This hellish fever
is on me again. I must keep my reason until this night is
over!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard, without answering, waddled to a chair, moved his
short legs outward, and let the attraction of gravitation do the
rest. The room shook with the impact, jangling empty cups
and glasses on the table. He drew out a silken handkerchief,
and with it odors of violet and vervain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oui, oui,&quot; he made answer at length, &quot;have your physician.
You will need him before you are through. And
when the servant comes, kindly order tea, sandwiches, coffee,
liqueurs, anything which may strengthen. Bah! It is vaudeville
tragedy!&quot; He settled himself with grunts and short
groans of distaste. Todd was deliberately overlooked. The
silent form gave both observers a sense of uneasiness.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre&#39;s orders given, strength suddenly deserted him. He
went to a couch, where pillows in Japanese brocades were
heaped. &quot;With your permission, gentlemen,&quot; he muttered.
He threw himself down upon his back, bending his head
upward into the soft squares, until the profile was drawn thin
and clear, as that of a mediæval figure on a tomb. All day
long, ever since his escape from the hospital (and could it be
possible that his flight had taken place since dawn of this
very day?), illness had toyed with him as a jungle tiger with
its prey, letting him go free for a moment, only to spring back,
fastening deeper claws. Now the fever held him, and moved
like a tumultuous sea across which was hung a molten, blinding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>[pg&nbsp;396]</span>
sheet of brass. Down in the valleys of the waves it was
dark, and cold, and terrible. Sea-creatures grimaced at him,
holding out long, wavering arms. Oh, the valleys were terrible
indeed! But up on the swelling crest was far worse, for
there he burned. Sometimes his brain went wild in the torment
of flame. His lips blistered and cracked. Once, when
he threw a hand suddenly upward, a pink finger-nail split to
the flesh. The intervals had a rhythm, a relentless, horrible
recurrence. He knew in anticipation the agony of each moment
just before it came. Now,&mdash;now he was beginning to rise,
to be borne up from the liquid, icy trough toward a plane of
fire. He groaned aloud, and cowered. Soft footsteps went
around the room. Porcelain or some such brittle substance
went clashing gently. To him it was as shells of the sea,
caught up with him in the wave; caught up from slimy depths,
like him; torn from a nether world of cold despair and whirled
upward, as he was being whirled! Soon they would crack,
too, and the pretty colors be burned and blackened. A voice
came out of the water. It sounded like Ronsard&#39;s voice.
&quot;Look at the young Monsieur! Diable! Fever is gaining.
I would he were safely back in the hospital.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why not take the responsibility of sending him
there?&quot; drawled the American&#39;s voice,&mdash;that thin, nasal, self-confident
voice that Pierre hated. It lashed now, like sea-nettles,
in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre writhed, and tried to toss aside the pillows. &quot;I
won&#39;t go back! You need not plan! You cannot force me!&quot;
he tried to scream. His parched lips opened. A hissing
noise came from his throat. He thought he had really
screamed the words, but the quiet, uninterrupted flow of conversation,
behind the wall of the wave convicted him terribly
of delusion. He gnashed his teeth, struggling to rise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God!&quot; cried Todd, reaching him at a bound. &quot;The
man is in convulsions. A doctor, quick, or he&#39;ll die here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard pressed a bell in frantic haste, and sent all the
Legation servants forth in search of physicians, warning
each to go in an individual direction. As a natural consequence,
they went in a frightened phalanx. Police-officers,
seeing the confusion, hurried in. Everywhere was dismay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[pg&nbsp;397]</span>
and disorganization. Todd alone retained a little judgment,
giving the sick man ammonia to smell, and bathing his forehead
with cold water.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a young American practitioner who first gained
the house. Had it been a German (of whom there are several
of world-wide reputation resident in Tokio), he, in
behalf of his reputation,&mdash;not to mention common sense,
would certainly have insisted upon sending the invalid back
to Yokohama, where, indubitably, he belonged. The American
being younger, more imaginative, and with less reputation
to jeopardize, might lend himself the more readily to the
unusual. Ronsard and Todd, each in his own way,&mdash;both,
of course, intensely desirous of getting Pierre safely in hospital
walls,&mdash;nevertheless advanced persuasions to keep him
away from the desirable haven until the following morning.
The physician was evidently puzzled by the presence of conflicting
motives. As a final statement of his own position,
he said, &quot;I insist that you gentlemen recognize the measures
I must employ to give him an interval of strength and lucidity
must take away at least fifty per cent of the patient&#39;s
chances of recovery!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd answered for both. &quot;We understand. It is the dickens
of a thing for us to have to decide on; yet, since the
man, if in his senses, would consider us traitors to shut him
up before eight to-night, I don&#39;t see anything else but to let
you dose him until that time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly,&quot; corroborated the French minister.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And, doctor,&quot; added Todd, in a slightly embarrassed tone,
&quot;it is a mess. We can&#39;t explain. Mum&#39;s the word, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I knew before you told me,&quot; said the young doctor.
Then he went to work.</p>

<p class="indent">An hour later Pierre, gasping, and pouring out from his
entire frame the very sap of vitality, still lay on the sofa, his
fever gone, his mind clear, uplifted, pellucid, as it had been
on awakening in Yuki&#39;s tea-rooms three hours before.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor had departed. Neither Todd nor the French
minister had left the room. The two politicians tacitly understood
that neither trusted the other, yet, strange to say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>[pg&nbsp;398]</span>
neither resented it. The issue at stake was too big for personal
irritation. In the reaction of his excitement Todd
pondered anew, with ever deepening foreboding, upon the
thing that Yuki&#39;s eyes had told him. Ronsard, overflowing
in his cushioned chair, brooded of France and her already
humiliated ally, Russia.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Le Beau,&quot; said Todd, at length, rising and walking in
the direction of the sofa, &quot;you&#39;re too sick a man to be
pounded by all the arguments I have been getting together
for you, but there are just a few things I must say, and
which his Excellency Count Ronsard here should hear me
say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speak,&quot; said Pierre, languidly; &quot;it will make no difference
at all, Monsieur, but I shall listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you to return that paper quietly, as a gentleman
should, and I want you to go back to the hospital, as a rational
being should. You are precipitating a crisis that Napoleon
in his best days might shrink from, and you are too
ill to stand on your feet. You don&#39;t know yet what you
are doing. Rely on stronger men, just now, and in all your
future life you will thank God that you listened!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre shifted his position slightly and tried to smile.
Ronsard placed himself at the other end of the couch. His
eyes held Todd. &quot;Before Pierre tries to answer, it is but
right to him, to France, that I should speak, your Excellency.&quot;
He went close to Pierre and touched him. &quot;Pierre,
I urge, with all the fervor, all the loyalty, all the passion of
a son of France, that you give up&mdash;not the paper; that is
ours,&mdash;but the woman. None but a coward and a sensualist
would sell away from his country a paper which commands so
terrible a price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am impaled upon the diameter of widely differing
opinions,&quot; said Pierre, sarcastically.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd&#39;s next words were very quiet. They were addressed
to Ronsard. &quot;The advice of your Excellency is both just
and creditable. You speak as a diplomat; I merely as a man.
I know what was in the paper, and I know also that a man&#39;s
honor, that nameless, indescribable essence which makes
him a man, once blackened, with the stain eaten in, can never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[pg&nbsp;399]</span>
be brightened. Pierre has but an hour or two to change
himself from a low thief to a man. Give up the paper,
Pierre, and save the woman you say you love!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah!&quot; Ronsard interrupted with a rudeness the others
scarcely had believed possible to him; &quot;you accuse Frenchmen
of sentimentality, Mr. Todd. What is this desire of
yours but sentiment, false sentiment, puerile, absurd? You
spur the boy&#39;s honor in order to save a woman who probably
does not wish to be saved. You play upon him! I
see a tear in his youthful eye. He thinks of Madame, deserted,&mdash;in
need of comfort! Who should condole with her
but he? Pouf! If you yearn to be a hero, Pierre, make of
that very desire a nobler sacrifice for France! Break your
heart if you will, but with the shattered fragments trace the
name of France! Upon this paper that you hold, the future
of a great war may hang. It has written instructions,&mdash;values,&mdash;perhaps
a secret treaty. Think what it may mean,
not only to our own land, to Russia, but to you!&quot; He
leaned to finger a little red ribbon dangling from a cigar-box
on the table. Pierre&#39;s eyes shot a dull gleam. &quot;When
Haganè comes, defy him,&mdash;break your word, retain the
paper, but give back the wife he so easily discards!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre had fallen back in his pillows. &quot;You don&#39;t know
what you are talking of,&mdash;neither knows,&quot; he said, tossing
his head feverishly. &quot;You will set my veins on fire again
with your chatter. Yuki, Haganè and I understand each
other&mdash;&quot; he broke off with a querulous gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd had begun to bristle. Sneers were rare to him,
but now his lean face assumed one. He caught up the red
ribbon which Ronsard had let fall, and cried to him, &quot;You
scorned the motive of honor, of pity for a woman, yet wave
the red flag of personal ambition. Pierre, can you not see
for yourself how flimsy is his argument? You think you
understand Yuki and her husband, but you do not. A terrific
tragedy hangs over us all. I insist, I implore you, Pierre,
try to reason this out for yourself, not as a Frenchman, a
lover, or a diplomat, but just as a man,&mdash;a man, and what
makes him a man, with a little fuse of God sputtering in
him, and not an animal minus the fuse, made up of intellect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[pg&nbsp;400]</span>
tastes, and inclinations! Think of that shivering, white-faced
girl,&mdash;that Oriental Jeanne d&#39;Arc who faced us all so
bravely an hour ago. I tell you, man, if you loved her
decently, you would turn sick at the thought of receiving her
at the hands of her lawful husband. Boy, try to think for
once in your life of some one besides yourself,&mdash;and may
God have mercy on you and my little Yuki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His voice broke on the last word. Ronsard jerked his
body, and gave a low sound of irritation. Pierre flared up
into feeble passion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I tell you, Mr. Todd, that you talk nonsense! I
have thought of Yuki,&mdash;only Yuki! I think now of no one
but Yuki. I too pitied her, and did what I could. I offered
to give the paper back into her hands, with the one condition
that Haganè should pardon what he fancies her offence
and should receive her back openly as his wife. They both
refused!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did what? Haganè refused <i>what</i>?&quot; exclaimed Todd.
He thought that the fever was again upon its victim. Ronsard
looked concerned and felt Pierre&#39;s white forehead. He
met their eyes triumphantly. He was pleased at the effect
of his words. Something in his boyish face impressed the
diplomats with the truth of the unbelievable statement just
made. &quot;Now, perhaps you will let me alone for a while,&quot; he
said disdainfully, and turned his back.</p>

<p class="indent">The elder men exchanged glances of dismay, and by a
common impulse left the couch. Pierre felt himself again
a conqueror. His words, like a querulous barking, followed
them. &quot;I really do not feel able to endure more talk, or
more tobacco-smoke, just now, gentlemen. The doctor said
I must have sleep before to-night. If I could only sleep!
After a fine deep sleep I should be strong again, the doctor
said it! But they will not let me alone,&mdash;they talk and
argue, but they are ignorant. Yuki and I understand each
other.&quot; With little childish, spasmodic movements he settled
himself among the sheens of brocade, keeping his face to the
wall. Small sounds of discontent, passing into moans and
feverish starts, came from him.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd stood, perplexed, by the table. Ronsard, in equal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>[pg&nbsp;401]</span>
agitation, hovered near, and then with a side glance at the
sick boy, crushed his cigarette into a tray. Todd&#39;s lean
shoulders bent over as with a weight. &quot;After that last,&quot;
he muttered, &quot;I guess I might as well clear out. Is there
anything further to discuss, your Excellency?&quot; he asked of
Ronsard.</p>

<p class="indent">The Frenchman&#39;s eyes shifted. His protruding underlip
trembled until he felt it shake, and raised a perfumed laden
handkerchief for a screen. Todd saw the uncertainty, the
battle between etiquette and fear in his colleague&#39;s face, and,
with a dry smile, took the paper from his breast, slapping it
down upon the bare table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear sir, my most valuable friend,&quot; began Ronsard,
in his oiliest manner, &quot;you tear my heartstrings with the
implied doubt. Your honor is not to be questioned. Yet I
would be glad to know just where you intend to remain this
fateful afternoon.&quot; The contrast between his tone and the
relief in his fat face were too much for Todd. He threw
back his head to laugh. Pierre, already dragged far out in
an undertow of sleep, did not turn, but Ronsard glanced up
suspiciously. His half-buried eyes had a tinge of red.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s just this way, Count,&quot; said the other, easily. &quot;I
know what is in this little billet,&mdash;you don&#39;t. I assure you
that the price is not big enough by half for the promised
reward. Yet if it were a thousand times bigger, and if I
dreaded and disapproved of the whole business ten thousand
times more than I do, yet, having given my word to Prince
Haganè and Yuki, and having accepted the&mdash;er&mdash;shall I
call it confidence?&mdash;of you and Le Beau, I should keep
strictly both to the letter and the spirit of my bargain. I
can&#39;t imagine, to be frank, the inner workings of a man
who could do anything else. I am an American. I have
been a senator, and I now represent my Government in a land
which fills me with the most intense admiration. Does that
put any lubricator on your troubled waves?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; purred the Frenchman, &quot;let us be seated
for a moment more. I thank your Excellency for these new
assurances, and appreciate the generosity of them. This has
been an afternoon of trial for me,&mdash;of deep humiliation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>[pg&nbsp;402]</span>
Your nobility adds but one more pang, and, in the name of
France, I can bear it! I shall give five hundred yen to the
poor of Tokio when this most detestable affair is at an end.
It is my first experience of the kind, and shall be my last.
Pierre&#39;s public dismissal from the service of this Legation will
be in the morning papers. I shelter him no longer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd made no comment. He had refused to take the proffered
seat. &quot;Your Excellency, I feel the need of fresh air.
I must go. But before leaving you I have two questions to
put,&mdash;answer or not as you think best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At your service, Monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you any knowledge of the motive which prompts
Yuki to take so strong, so vital a part in this hellish arrangement&mdash;and&mdash;do
you know her offence?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can answer both. The first is obvious enough. Madame
has the natural desire to pass from the arms of winter to that
of spring. The other query,&mdash;I cannot give a positive reply,
but will share the data.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd waited in silence. Ronsard arranged his words with
some nicety. &quot;In the first excitement of Le Beau&#39;s arrival,&mdash;as
he came in like a maniac, waving a white screed, and
gasping out to me its nature,&mdash;I cried, &#39;Then where is
Haganè? He must be close behind you!&#39; Pierre, with a
meaning glance, assured me that the great man could not
follow, being&mdash;detained.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Detained? Well, go on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I marvelled, as you do, at the phrase. &#39;Detained,&#39; Pierre
said,&mdash;entangled, tied, quite cleverly, by Madame and her
long gray sleeves. Did you not notice the disarray of
Madame&#39;s toilette?&quot; Ronsard looked up now full at his colleague,
as if to enjoy the effect. Todd steadied himself. He
would not give this man the satisfaction of gloating over new
wounds. The whole terrible thing came clear to him. He
saw why Yuki needed to die. It was no punishment inflicted
by Haganè, but a last desperate self-atonement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; he answered Ronsard, with wonderful coolness,
&quot;I thank your Excellency for the elucidation. It is complete.
Now, with your permission, and if your mind is
entirely at rest, I will say &#39;Good-bye until to-night at eight.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[pg&nbsp;403]</span>
&quot;Certainly,&quot; bowed the count, who did not relish this
acrobatic reversion to tranquillity. &quot;The disclosure, I trust,
makes no difference in your&mdash;sentiments.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heavens, man! how could it? I&#39;m not a tin fish on a
red barn, to wheel round with every wind! Don&#39;t you see it
is as much to me as anybody else that the thing gets back,
unopened, to Haganè?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, I presume so,&quot; muttered Ronsard, and accompanied
his colleague to the door. The American went
out on foot. Ronsard slowly retraced his heavy steps to
Pierre. Stopping beside the sleeper, he stared down, first
thoughtfully, then in growing antipathy and disgust. France,
America, political acumen, possible distinction for himself or
Todd,&mdash;all were blocked by this sick animal who lay, inert as
a log, clear across the current of affairs. Well, endurance
came with the thought that a few hours more would see
the end!</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard turned away at length, moved restlessly around
the room, and at last, with a resigned sigh, took out a pack
of cards, drew a table before a long pier-glass, and, solemnly
dealing two hands, played piquet with his silent, gray shade,
until the day went out, and the first purple waves of night
came rushing in across a soundless shore.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> had been said of Mr. Cyrus C. Todd that one might
recognize him for an American half a mile away. The alertness,
buoyancy, and self-confidence of a growing nation had
expression through him. He held himself like a flagstaff
from which waved the Stars and Stripes. To-day the bright
invisible folds clung about him like a shroud. He felt the
weight of tears upon them, tears that soon must be shed.
Look where he would, no door of escape for Yuki opened.
After all it was so much more Haganè&#39;s affair and Pierre&#39;s
and even Ronsard&#39;s! But what comfort would this reply
bring to Gwendolen? Ah, there was the pang! Gwendolen,
who had known no sister but this frail bit of pearl and moonlight
that held so deep a soul! Todd&#39;s head sagged between
his shoulders. His step lost firmness. He was a man aged,
to outward appearance, ten years in a day.</p>

<p class="indent">An inspiring bit of news had come during that forenoon
from Manchuria. The land-engagements by which Russia
was to restore her prestige lost at sea, and inflict a terrible
retribution on her audacious enemies, had begun, and Japan,
as on sea, was victor. At another time Todd would have
rejoiced with the nation. Now the whole campaign became
to his fevered imagination a colossal Juggernaut destined to
crush one little girl,&mdash;a wheel of fate (karma, Yuki would
have termed it) on which a white moth should be broken.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd seldom gave himself over to self-communion, yet
those long days in the bright loneliness of his wheat-fields
had once bred the habit. An ominous and most mysterious
factor in his thought was a sense of pre-knowledge, of a
relentless inevitability, of the desirability, even, of the sacrifice.
The thing came, like a predestined growth, from the
soil of necessity. &quot;Joint knit to joint expands the full
formed fate.&quot; As if, indeed, some ghostly counsellor leaned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>[pg&nbsp;405]</span>
to him, the event, from which his human, his conventional
selves recoiled, shuddering, seemed to his spirit a thing designed,
not cruelly, by the Gods themselves. Yet to think
of Yuki&mdash;his little Yuki&mdash;dead with her youth folded like
helpless wings about her! The man groaned and stumbled
in his path, as, weeks before, Pierre Le Beau, dazed with a
more ignoble grief, had groaned and stumbled on these very
stones.</p>

<p class="indent">The day was Friday, the hour approaching five of the
afternoon. Little girls in brilliant-colored kimonos played
ball, or hop-scotch, or hide-and-seek around the corners of the
streets. Solemn-looking babies, with a mat of black hair
tipped to the backs of otherwise smoothly shaven heads,
loitered, engrossed apparently in Zen meditation, in the
vicinity of their elders. The clothes of these pygmy abbots
being wadded both in front and back, one, in his abstraction,
toppling over, might regain his equilibrium with a single
bound, like round-bottomed toys that always stand on end. Infants
of a size smaller had warm swallows&#39; nests slung from
the backs of elder sisters. These living burdens made no
difference at all in the freedom of sports, or in the slumbers
of those carried. In hop-scotch, the heads of the babes went
up and down with each hop, until the slender necks should
have snapped. But, no, babies were meant to pass most of
their existence in this manner, and being Japanese, they
took it philosophically. Sun, wind, or even a light snow
might fall on the upturned faces, and sleep still line the
swallow nest.</p>

<p class="indent">Schoolboys, in little squads, passed at intervals. Some
among them must have been of the very lot who had once
informed Pierre of the meaning of &quot;Ikusa!&quot; Many wore the
foreign school uniform of dark-blue woollen cloth made into
scanty trousers and &quot;bob&quot; jackets. With this outfit went,
inevitably, coarse leather shoes. Other students had been to
their homes to change the regulation school garb for the more
comfortable wadded kimono, held in place by soft white
girdles in endless yards of cloth, and completed with Japanese
geta or clogs. All alike wore dark-blue military caps with
the names of their school across the front in Chinese ideographs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>[pg&nbsp;406]</span>
of gold. Their faces were smooth and brown; their
eyes like dark jewels. They looked fearlessly upon the tall
American. A few lifted their caps lightly, in token of
respect, but many more stared, and often turned away with
an independence very close upon audacity. Todd, in spite of
his troubled reverie, was beguiled into smiling at them. Few
indeed responded to his pleasant look. It savored to them
of condescension. Abreast with a small battalion of young
swaggerers, Todd, for an experiment, said distinctly, &quot;Banzai
Nippon!&quot; The boys stood as if electrified. Todd pointed
to his button of the Order of the Rising Sun. Suddenly caps
and voices went high in air. &quot;Banzai Nippon! Banzai
Nippon!&quot; they shouted. They crowded now about the
minister, their faces all smiles, the mistrust vanished. They
examined his button eagerly, then his watch-charm, his necktie,
pin, and signet-ring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A-rr-e you the A-mer-i-kan?&quot; asked one, in rheumatic
English.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Todd. &quot;I am the new American minister,&mdash;A-mer-i-ca
no K&#333;shi.&quot; This was one of the few
Japanese phrases he had acquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Banzai Nippon! Banzai Nippon!&quot; came the renewed
shout. &quot;American good friend to Nip-pon&mdash;yes?&quot; asked
another lad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Huh! We all same lick off Russia&#39;s boots,&quot; growled a
surly youth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I hope you do,&mdash;though you mustn&#39;t say I said
it!&quot; laughed Todd. &quot;Good-bye! Good-bye! You are fine
boys!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye! Good-bye, sirr!&quot; called out the boys after him,
with caps in hand. It is to be regretted that most of them
said, &quot;Gooroo-bye-roo!&quot; but the sentiment, at least, was
faultless.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd, looking back to them, wondered whether there were
any incipient Togos, Kurokis, and Haganès among the striplings.
He sighed. The untarnished enthusiasms of youth
are always saddening,&mdash;though very precious. One of the
boys looked like Yuki. The likeness led him back, like a
jailer, to his dark cell of meditation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[pg&nbsp;407]</span>
&quot;What am I to say to Gwendolen?&quot; was now his despairing
cry. Gwendolen&#39;s eager questions, Gwendolen&#39;s clear
eyes,&mdash;they would soon be torture-irons. She knew enough
of the situation to have a right to all, yet how on earth was
he to tell of a thing which no one had stated to himself,&mdash;a
fleck of terrible certainty drifting to his gaze from Yuki&#39;s
soul? Now a revulsion against the whole morbid situation
flooded his being. He felt as he had sometimes felt in dreams
when a horrible thing crept near, and he, though half-conscious
that it was only a dream, still sub-consciously must
endure the pangs of reality until he could wrench himself
awake. Perhaps this also might prove a phantasm of the
night! He snatched at the delusion. The voices of young
children, the whirr of the low red sun through fleeting
jinrikisha wheels, the gentle, restraining touch upon his hand
of falling petals, jeered softly at the self-deceiver.</p>

<p class="indent">The city streets shortened now to purple vistas. Across
from the smouldering west a single planet, isolated by its
own brightness, preened itself with feathers of light. Todd&#39;s
thoughts moved on like the shadow-pictures of a revolving
lantern. Each was a silhouette, black, angular, menacing.
If Yuki had indeed held Haganè inert, if an impulse of love,
even of pity for a sick man, had prevented the instant regaining
of such a paper, naturally she must get it back, though
at the price of her life. But what did the babbling sick boy
mean by saying that he had offered to return the paper to
Haganè, if only Yuki would be forgiven, and that both as
with one voice had refused? Here was the knot that pulled.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè did not hate or scorn his young wife; Todd would
stake his honor on that point. Never had a human countenance
shone with deeper tenderness than that which Haganè
had turned on Yuki within a few moments, too, of her wrongdoing.
The more urgently she had insisted upon fulfilling
the bargain, the brighter the faith in her that Haganè&#39;s eyes
had betrayed. Yuki&#39;s secret was plain enough. She was to
die by her own hand, giving her hostage of a soul to Haganè,
the body of her death to Pierre. Both she and Haganè had
been assiduous to use the one term &quot;body.&quot; Todd could
understand this much, but what was Haganè&#39;s hidden source
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>[pg&nbsp;408]</span>
of light? Here conjecture failed. If Yuki&#39;s death were the
only possible way of redeeming the paper, all motives would
be plain; but Pierre said that he had offered to restore it.
This was a great thing for Pierre to have done. Todd&#39;s heart
ached for the poor, weak, tortured boy, so soon to be overwhelmed
in an iridescent wreck of his own making.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki was to die! This one thing alone was terrible enough.
His weary thought went on in a creaking treadmill. To
Haganè the mere fact of death would, of course, be less terrible
and less important. Mere animal existence, for its own
sake, no matter how pleasant the surroundings, is scorned
by a true Japanese. They have other lives to live, even on
this old planet. They are to come again, soothed and
strengthened by the few years of interval, each in the fresh,
new body of a little child. In such tender blossoms of their
own race they re-enter a world from which, smiling or shivering,
as karma may have tended, they departed. Returning,
they are dazed, a little wistful, a little timorous, yet
grateful for the new chance. Believing that great sorrow and
great temptation come always from the deeds of a previous
existence, they meet them bravely, carrying their own burdens,
clear in determination to retrieve that past, and mark
out for the future a straighter and a higher way. The gentle
Amida, Kwannon of Mercy, Jizo with the tender smile,&mdash;all
may help them. Fudo Sama, immovable in a torment of
flame, Monju, Aizen, and the old Shinto Gods may give
them strength; but each human soul has wrapped in itself
the power of growth and of decay. So, mounting, striving,
failing, reconquering, at last the pilgrim may approach that
shining mystery the world calls &quot;Nirvana,&quot;&mdash;that glare of
glory where the soul is swallowed up in light, and so passes
on to new realms of a radiance so ineffable that human thought
falls helpless and blind before it.</p>

<p class="indent">He had heard Yuki tell all this to Gwendolen before the
days of her Christian conversion. His listening had been
more eager than he cared to show. Gwendolen had voiced
his thought, as she replied, with a long sigh of wonder, &quot;It
does seem reasonable. So many things that we have to guess
at are explained by this thing you call reincarnation. Love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[pg&nbsp;409]</span>
at first sight, sudden aversions, family tendencies, that
queer feeling of having been in a new place many times before&mdash;I
think I&#39;ll turn Buddhist, Yuki; but don&#39;t hint it
to mama.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki had become a Christian. She believed her early
religious training to have passed forever. She was sincere
and earnest in the new faith. Her face turned, as by a gentle
instinct, to the Star of Bethlehem. All that she professed,
she believed truly and without question. Yet this life of
hers was, after all, but a flower sprung from an eternal stem,
whose roots were packed, burrowed, and buried deep in centuries
of Eastern mysticism. She had drawn her convictions
from her mother&#39;s breast, while, to belief of the tender
nurse, ancestral spirits hovered and smiled above them both.
She had breathed it in each year at Bon Matsuri, the Festival
of the Dead, when little boats, laden with prayer and incense
and the warmth of human food, went forth to comfort the
souls of those who had died at sea, when each hillside
cemetery stirred with the soft clashing of ghostly lanterns,
luminous in a spectral ether, when little steaming cups of
tea, and flowers, and children&#39;s toys, were offered to the dead
ghost-people. Here were the meeting-places of the living
and the dead. Here the two worlds answered, face to face,
as reflections in still water. Yuki, in those childish days, no
more doubted that hordes of spirits moved about her, lifting
her hair, creeping into her sleeve, reaching even to the shelter
of her faithful heart, than, later, in America she had doubted
the presence of her human schoolmates, sitting in rows before
wooden desks.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, above the blood-wet battlefields, the spirits of
the great heroes of the past, worshipped by generations of
the Japanese faithful, were hovering, to test, by their supreme
standards of valor and endurance, the gray hosts of
new aspirants for immortality. Yuki would feel that they
were her judges also.</p>

<p class="indent">And the gentle Gods would be near,&mdash;Kwannon, Jizo,
Amida&mdash;standing in great shining nebulæ of faith on the
rim of night.</p>

<p class="indent">These sweeter visions passed, and the dark monitor in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[pg&nbsp;410]</span>
Todd&#39;s brain set him the task of fathoming Pierre&#39;s deed.
The boy had stolen. Contempt swept from the thinker&#39;s
mind its late compassion. Illness alone might partially
excuse it; but in delirium, as in drunkenness, the latent impulse
often shows itself. And Pierre, a young French dandy,
a thief, expected to make, that night, such a woman as the
Princess Haganè utterly his own. Yuki had probably saved
his life at the expense of hers. His grateful reward would
be to defame her. Then why would Haganè not take her
back? Was she unworthy, simply through the act of saving
Pierre, or was there a lower reason? No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;the
man cried out to himself. Yuki could not be evil. If Haganè
believed it of her, he could not have so smiled; he had the
look of a high-priest bent upon a beloved penitent. And that
Ronsard should have believed,&mdash;a man who could speak and
understand the Japanese language, who had lived among the
people for eleven years! Having faced another blank wall,
Todd turned.</p>

<p class="indent">He fell now to wondering in what way Yuki would choose
to die. The long strain began to tell on him. Morbid
thoughts and fancies assailed him. He almost gloated over
the anticipation of Pierre&#39;s agony when he should be paid his
price. But how would Yuki die? Would she be alone, or
Haganè with her? Would her hand or his deal the final blow&mdash;give
Death his first sweet sip of her? The two would be
together; yes, it must be so; and the scene, unwitnessed
though it was, one of unrivalled heroism, the silent speech of
two Gods alone on a cloudy mountain-top. And what was he
to say to Gwendolen!</p>

<p class="indent">The treadmill creaked again, and registered the notch of another
empty revolution. Now Todd shook himself and raised
his eyes to see how far he had come. Not a hundred yards
ahead of him began the slope of Azabu. Blackening swiftly
against the copper sky loomed the great Japanese entrance to
his Legation. Evidently he must decide swiftly what to tell
or not to tell his daughter. He thought of Dodge. Dodge
knew the Japanese better than he; maybe he knew girls
better. In the breaking of the news to Gwendolen he might
be of great help. Then the tiny flicker of comfort died.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>[pg&nbsp;411]</span>
Dodge and Gwendolen were playing at being enemies. They
scarcely spoke. It was a lover&#39;s quarrel, Todd supposed, for
Dodge certainly loved her; and the sudden friendship, on
the girl&#39;s part, of a successful rival betrayed clearly her sentiments.
Lovers&#39; quarrels were well enough in their way;
but why should this have come just now when Dodge could
be of use?</p>

<p class="indent">He drew a sigh that racked the meagre frame, and started up
the slope. &quot;Kuruma, Dan-na San! Rick-shaw,&mdash;Dan-na
San?&quot; cried a group of coolies who had a little station at
the base of the hill. Their accents were persuasive, even
plaintive. They moved forward in a body, the empty black
vehicles (inseparable from them as shells from snails) rattling
behind them. They clamored like crows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don&#39;t want you. No, I say, I-I-yè! Go back,&quot;
he cried, and waved them off, with some irritation at their
persistence.</p>

<p class="indent">The smooth gravelled driveway of the hill might have been
a trough of viscid red clay, to judge from the slow and dragging
steps of the one who now ascended it. The rejected
coolies, staring up from the street level, assured one another
that the tall foreigner was both sick and stingy. For the
latter fault they hoped he would fall down before reaching
the top of the hill. Then they would run to him, and charge
a yen apiece for picking him up. They began to ascend,
stealthily, like human vultures.</p>

<p class="indent">The dark spot of his ascending head could scarcely have
been seen through the opened gate, when, in a whirl of rustling
skirts, Gwendolen came down upon him. &quot;I cannot tell
her,&quot; he muttered between clenched teeth, as she came.
&quot;I shall die. She must not know what I believe!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gwendolen did not reproach him for being late, though he
had thought her first words would be a playful chiding. She
did not speak at all, only took his arm, pressed it lovingly
with her own, and with cheek sometimes laid for an instant
against his shoulder made the rest of the ascent with him.
The tenderness, the consideration of her manner, touched
him profoundly. He looked down into her face, white and
fair even in the dying light. She smiled up at him. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[pg&nbsp;412]</span>
saw a new beauty, a hint of new strength in her. For a
moment his harassed sense clutched the impossible. Maybe
good news of Yuki had come to her!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, child? You look different? What has
happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She gave a low little laugh, and did not answer. They had
nearly reached the gate. In the great shadow a smaller
shadow stepped out to join them. Gwendolen put out a
white hand and drew it near. &quot;This is what has happened,
father&mdash;&quot; she whispered. &quot;We are&mdash;friends again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Friends?&quot; echoed Todd; &quot;you and Mr. Dodge,&mdash;thank
God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Friends!&quot; came Dodge&#39;s pleasant voice; &quot;well I rather
guess not!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gwendolen,&quot; said her father, drawing her close, &quot;is this
true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She clung to him, crying just a little in her excitement.
&quot;Yes, dad, if you are willing&mdash;if it will not make you
unhappy. He has talked with me,&mdash;of the other thing;
he has comforted me,&mdash;though he believes it to be, oh, so
terrible! Are you&mdash;willing, dearest father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd put an arm around each, pressing the brown and the
golden heads close. &quot;I wish it of all things,&quot; he said.
&quot;Dodge is an American and a gentleman; nothing is better
than that. Just now this&mdash;happiness of yours is a gift of
God, for I bring nothing joyous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell us everything,&quot; pleaded Gwendolen. &quot;I can stand
anything now; my heart couldn&#39;t break with you one side of
it, and h-him the other.&quot; Dodge went around to his side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;guess it would be safer to tell it in the private
office,&quot; said Todd, beginning to fumble for a handkerchief.
&quot;To tell you the truth, Gwen,&mdash;I&#39;d really like&mdash;if you
don&#39;t mind, my dears,&mdash;to turn woman and have one good
cry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on,&quot; said Gwendolen; &quot;I&#39;ll cry with you. I am
so mi-mi-miserable and hap-hap-happy, I just can&#39;t&mdash;&quot;
She broke off in tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m in!&quot; said Dodge, pulling out his handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">Laughing and crying together, with arms around one another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>[pg&nbsp;413]</span>
they went in at the tall gate and to the ambassador&#39;s
little den.</p>

<p class="indent">In the big house, in the drawing-room, Mrs. Stunt and
Madame Todd exchanged mild confidences and cooking
recipes. The latter had refused for once to discuss the
affairs either of Pierre or Madame Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">And so the night came in.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>[pg&nbsp;414]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTY</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Night</span> in Japan, when the day has been all or partly clear,
is a deepening mystery, a revelation of purple tones and
velvet shadows. In the French Legation garden (designed
originally for the delight of a feudal daimyo and afterward
given as part of the French concession for official buildings)
the soft blurred dusk concealed all but the vaguest suggestions
of copse and path and hillock. A wanderer on the dew-drenched
gravel might perceive about him, as by instinct, the
beauty of line and mass. The smell of daphne and azalea
flowers rose with pungent sweetness. Higher trees and
mounds, set with rolling shrubs, rose against the sky-line
and the stars like great crouching earth-clouds.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre moved up and down the driveway just below the
steps that led down from a balcony on the quiet west side of
the house. Ignoring the doctor&#39;s orders, he had come a full
hour before the appointed time. Ronsard, seeing his intention,
had expostulated vehemently, using both language and
gesticulation, but soon shrugged off the obligation with the
reviving thought, &quot;Only an hour more, and it will be over!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Pierre had walked at will. He drew in heavy breaths
of the scented, humid air. He believed himself impervious
now to further illness. He would not have listened or believed
if one had told him that his present interlude of
fictitious strength was like the shade of a upas-tree in a
scorching desert. One cigarette after another was smoked
and thrown at random among the shrubs, where each in turn
lay like a malicious glow-worm, hissing and winking away
an acrid spite. In the west a faint shining stirred the
advent of the moon.</p>

<p class="indent">At ten minutes to eight o&#39;clock Mr. Todd arrived. He was
ushered at once, by order, into the small drawing-room where
Ronsard sat. His face had new lines of struggle, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[pg&nbsp;415]</span>
very pale, but self-possession was evident in every gesture.
His first act on reaching Ronsard was to draw out the paper,
saying, &quot;This, sir, has not left my body, or been touched by
any hand but mine, or been referred to by any speech, since
the moment, a few hours since, when I left you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In his long, earnest explanation to Gwendolen and Dodge,
Todd had, indeed, carefully refrained from letting them know
that he was personal guardian of the document. It might
have opened for them another blind trail of argument. During
that agonizing interview he had thanked fate a hundred
times for the part that Dodge had so opportunely been qualified
to play. The clear judgment, intense sympathy, and
clever resourcefulness of the young diplomat delighted him
even in the midst of tragic exercise. It had taken the utmost
skill of both men to overpower Gwendolen&#39;s first keen desire
to go to her friend, to make the girl see that interference on
her part had become impossible. He had left her half-fainting,
though still insistent in her belief that God could not
allow such a crime!</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard rose as the guest entered. He, too, had gained a
certain fatalistic calm. In reply to Todd&#39;s elaborate explanation,
he had said simply, &quot;Return the paper to its place,
your Excellency. The farce will soon be over. Shall we not
join our young imbecile in the garden?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They paced together wide dimly lighted rooms, and emerged
upon the uncovered western balcony. Pierre looked up and,
wordless, continued his rapid, nervous strides.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;ll kill himself, the fool,&quot; muttered Todd. &quot;The mist
piles in like thin cotton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is too late even for his death to be of assistance,&quot; said
Ronsard, with bitter animosity. His small eyes darted loathing
after his young compatriot. He thrust pudgy hands
deep into pockets below the equator of his belt, and rocked
to and fro on his heels. Suddenly the pent-up discomfort,
the apprehension, the strain of the situation clutched him
anew. &quot;God!&quot; he cried aloud, and shook himself until the
fat trembled. &quot;As you say, Monsieur, no man is worth all
this, nor woman either, least of all that puling hind yonder!
Only a great cause is worth it,&mdash;the service for one&#39;s native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>[pg&nbsp;416]</span>
land. I have tried to think of France&mdash;of France only.
My country is to be cheated. I can do nothing; yet still I
wallow in this tepid slime! How has it come about? You
will give Haganè the paper, if he brings the woman with
him!&quot; He broke off, and after a keen look into Todd&#39;s unresponsive
face began to walk in short, broken steps up and
down the stone flooring.</p>

<p class="indent">His words had rung out clearly. Pierre must have heard
each one; but if so, he made no sign. Pierre had now but
one thing to think of,&mdash;his price, the woman that would
soon be here.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd leaned against a corner pedestal, and Ronsard, after a
moment, paused in his meaningless exercise, and stood again
before his colleague. The two pairs of eyes met and fenced.
Todd might have been made of wood. After a long glance
Ronsard freed his right hand from its pocket and began pulling
at the moist, red underlip. &quot;You will of course, in any
case, give up the paper at first appearance of Haganè and
Madame?&quot; His voice slid querulously upward with interrogation
in the pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Todd, distinctly. &quot;I conceive it to be my part
to return the paper at that moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Er&mdash;had we not better pause to see whether Madame
tends to prove after all&mdash;recalcitrant?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The bargain said nothing of that. Pierre gets his price,&mdash;the
person of Yuki, so they always worded it; Haganè
gets the paper. It is simple enough. We don&#39;t need a lightning-calculator.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hark!&quot; said Pierre, pausing, stricken, just beneath them.
&quot;Is it not the sound of&mdash;wheels?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All became silent, alert, intent. The faint, low crackle
and clatter of a kuruma on gravel, a vehicle slowly drawn,
came apparently from the far end of the garden, just under
the spot where the moon rose.</p>

<p class="indent">From the battlements of the white house beside them, the
great pale house standing upright like an opened volume in
the night, a queer flutter came, swart wings went beating
against the stars, and a crow laughed aloud with raucous
joy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>[pg&nbsp;417]</span>
&quot;A crow at night! It means, among these people, death!&quot;
said Ronsard.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre started violently, and dropped his last cigarette.
&quot;Damn the flying fiend!&quot; he cursed aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">The crunching of wheels drew near. They moved with increasing
sluggishness. Each click had a sound of protest.
To Pierre&#39;s tortured hearing, all noises crawled backward.</p>

<p class="indent">By this the moon was in the tops of enoki, camphor, and
tall camellia trees. Where its light touched curves of shelled
and smoothly gravelled paths, the spaces were of snow.</p>

<p class="indent">Out from the great red pagoda of Shiba temple, not half a
mile away, came the first stir, the throb, the murmur of a
great bell struck tentatively by its swinging cedar beam,
before receiving in full strength the initial stroke of eight.
&quot;One!&quot; the great bronze pendant boomed. &quot;Two!&quot; came
more slowly and on a higher note, sending swifter ripples
to overtake the first scurrying elves of sound. &quot;Three!&quot;
&quot;Four!&quot; It swung majestically until the last stroke, piling
echoes deep, filled the whole shell of night with discontent,
and sank, a dew of sound, on listening leaves.</p>

<p class="indent">With the first tone, the jinrikisha wheels had stopped.
The great crow, shaken from his height, had fled. Pursued
far off by melodious echoes, he flapped his wings and screamed.
A cricket near the steps awoke, jarred from his winter sleep
by vibrant summons. The needle of his shrill, incongruous
song pierced to the listeners&#39; hearts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother of God!&quot; cried Pierre, smiting his clammy forehead,
&quot;how is it that I live at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Around a curved hillock directly bordering a path, straight
into unhindered light, came the white hat and stooping
shoulders of a coolie. Behind him dragged the dark bulk
of a covered vehicle. Pierre half fainted against the steps.
&quot;She has come alone&mdash;alone&mdash;&quot; he cried in exultation. Regaining
his feet he wheeled to the two men watching from
the balcony. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he cried with a gesture, &quot;may I
entreat you to leave,&mdash;for these first moments?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The coolie came on like a heavy machine.</p>

<p class="indent">Ronsard, at Pierre&#39;s question, transferred his weight from
one foot to the other, and then looked at Todd. The latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>[pg&nbsp;418]</span>
deliberately walked down the shallow steps and stood on the
gravel beside Pierre. The white hat of the coolie fronted
them like a silver shield. Pierre scowled upon the American,
and gave a sound of anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Todd, calmly. &quot;But I promised to be
present during just these first moments. Prince Haganè has
my word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prince Haganè!&quot; echoed Pierre, with a hoarse laugh that
was kin to the crow&#39;s. &quot;Where is Prince Haganè? Backed
out at the last, as I thought he would&mdash;like the coward and
bully that he is! There has no Haganè come, don&#39;t you see?
Only Yuki&mdash;my darling&mdash;my poor little love. I see her
white dress yonder!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The coolie straightened himself, flung the wide hat sideways
with a single fierce sweep of arm, and turned to the
wondering observers the set, livid face and burning eyes of
Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prince Haganè is here,&quot; he said quietly, and tried to
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">His peasant hat, skimming along the gravel, touched now
and again with a hissing sound the surface of small stones.
At length in a small patch of moonlight it came to rest, and
lay rocking slightly, and gaping upward like a mendicant&#39;s
bowl.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre cowered. Ronsard nearly fell. &quot;Prince Haganè
in coolie&#39;s garb! What new horror is this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suppose we call it&mdash;delicacy,&quot; suggested Haganè.
&quot;Could any secrecy be too great for such a meeting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Todd narrowed his lids. Haganè kept a hand close upon
one shaft of the little vehicle, conserving the upright posture.
The black hood, bent far over to the front, completely concealed
the occupant; but the dazzling white of a gown with
pale embroideries, and the faint odor of flowers and of sandalwood
now stealing upon the night air, should, in any case,
have betrayed her sex.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki&mdash;Yuki, you have really come!&quot; cried Pierre, and
would have rushed to her but for the obstruction of Haganè&#39;s
arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First, the paper,&quot; said Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>[pg&nbsp;419]</span>
Todd jerked out the document. Ronsard held him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait; there is something damnable in that still white
thing there in the rickshaw. Wait and see whether it is
really Madame la Princesse, or a substitute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè stared one moment upon the speaker with lips that
writhed backward, showing teeth like a baited boar. &quot;His
Excellency is always prudent. See, gentlemen, for yourselves,
that I have brought my wife. Mr. Todd, have the
document ready!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With an almost imperceptible motion Haganè slipped from
its nail the black, taut twine that held the lowered hood. It
rattled back with the noise of the spokes of a giant fan.
Yuki sat upright,&mdash;the full moon just behind her,&mdash;smiling.
The little hands were clasped tightly in her lap. The coils
of her orchid hair had the glint and sheen of the crow&#39;s
wing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is Yuki,&mdash;certainement!&quot; screamed Pierre, in ecstasy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold back that paper!&quot; roared Ronsard.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd stood on tiptoe. One long thin arm went up like
the derrick of a dredging-machine. His hand held something
square and white with a black blotch on it. The arm
lowered. Haganè reached up, took the paper, and thrust it
deep into the breast of his coolie robe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The paper&mdash;&quot; groaned Ronsard; &quot;it is gone forever!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Yuki,&quot; cried Pierre, &quot;has come to be mine forever!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, gentlemen,&quot; said Haganè, again restraining
Pierre. &quot;You were all present at the agreement between
Monsieur Le Beau and me. The paper is now regained, and
here is its price; here is Onda Yuki-ko.&quot; He placed the shafts
of the little vehicle on the lowest stair, and stepped out
sheer upon the walk. Pierre, like an animal released, sprang
to Yuki, knelt by her, caught her hands, and began whispering
words of love.</p>

<p class="indent">Now for the first time Todd groaned aloud, and walked to
a little distance. Ronsard followed him. But the Japanese
stood immovable, his eyes on Yuki&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My beloved, my beloved,&mdash;I know now that I have not
believed in this ecstasy! But you are here! Come, dear
one, you must be chilled in the night air. How quiet you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>[pg&nbsp;420]</span>
are and pale! It must be the moonlight. And your little
hands are cold! Why do you not speak, love! Are you
trying to frighten me? This is not the time for dainty
trickery! Speak, for God&#39;s sake! I have been so long on
the rack my very soul is sore! Why do you smile so, and
never change? Your cheek is colder than your hands.&mdash;O
God, a thought is coming that will turn me, too, into ice!
Yuki, Yuki, what strange thing is this rooted in your heart,&mdash;what
grim hilt with twisted dragons? I see the crest of
the Haganè clan! Yuki&mdash;Yuki&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She wishes the dagger not removed, Monsieur. It keeps
her sacrificial robes&mdash;immaculate.&quot; Haganè spoke like a
machine.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre, the other side of Yuki, rose to his feet. His
eyeballs swelled and rolled in the moonlight, giving him a
look of frenzy. &quot;Who is that that speaks to me? Has
night a voice? What spirit hides behind that mask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Death,&quot; said Haganè, calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre writhed beside the vehicle, and then became very
still. The other listeners turned, expecting an outburst of
maniacal grief,&mdash;perhaps a murderous assault on Haganè.
Pierre&#39;s composure was more terrible than any speech. He
smoothed one of Yuki&#39;s hands, and, after a pause, began
speaking directly to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So this has been his plan, dear? I might have guessed.
He knew he was to kill you. Oh, the deed suited him! He
called me a thief; but what has he not stolen? Wait for
me somewhere, darling,&mdash;I cannot say just where it will be;
but after&mdash;I will meet you. If sickness does not free me,
I myself will loose this tortured soul and find you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She died by her own hand. That dagger was already in
her heart as you, with the stolen paper, left my room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he is trying to hide,&mdash;to shield himself behind you,
poor little one!&quot; said Pierre to the dead woman.</p>

<p class="indent">A shadow on the nearest hillock moved. Todd went nearer
to examine it, but could see no living thing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Time presses,&quot; said Haganè, speaking always in the same
dull, hopeless way. &quot;Our bargain was clearly stated. Shall
I now leave with you the body, Monsieur Le Beau, or shall I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>[pg&nbsp;421]</span>
retrace my steps as I came, giving honorable burial to the
Princess Haganè?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Le Beau, you cannot hesitate at such a question,&quot; cried
Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pierre, Pierre, in the name of France, compromise us
no further! You have done harm enough. Let the poor sacrifice
go in peace!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre caught Yuki to him, his arm about her shoulder,
her glossy hair, with the white flowers, strained against his
heart. Like a trapped beast he defied them all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I&#39;ll not give her up. You are all false,&mdash;all have
betrayed me. If I am to have nothing else, I keep at least
the frail shell of what she was! Oh, I shall kiss&mdash;kiss&mdash;kiss&mdash;her
into life, or myself into her cold, white death.
Yes, go, you toad of Hell!&quot; he screamed toward Haganè.
&quot;Leave my price with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Though dead, she still has reputation&mdash;family honor,&quot;
Haganè said.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre threw back his head for a derisive laugh. Just then
a strange thing happened. From the hillock nearby a
crouching shrub seemed to detach itself and spring. It was
a man,&mdash;the old samurai Onda. Haganè had told him to be
there. Before interposition could be made, he had thrown
himself on Pierre, taken Yuki from his arms, thrown her
back in the kuruma, and stood in an attitude of menace
between them. &quot;Keep your hands from my daughter! Keep
your devil&#39;s hands from the Princess Haganè!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we interfere?&quot; whispered Todd to Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I can do all,&quot; he said. Then to Onda, &quot;Keep
back, old friend. It is his right,&mdash;the price that we have
paid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Master, Master,&quot; cried the kerai, almost sobbing in his
excitement, &quot;let me slay him&mdash;let me slay all three! I
will die the self-death, or be hanged, with equal satisfaction.
Only let me slay!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These others are just men, and my friends,&quot; said Haganè
gravely. &quot;The young madman yonder is protected by my
word. We must think, too, of Nippon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Old Onda&#39;s breathing rasped the silence.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>[pg&nbsp;422]</span>
&quot;Monsieur Le Beau,&quot; said Haganè again, &quot;you are fully
determined to retain the body&mdash;and give her name to public
defamation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What else is there for me, devil?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you have been her lover,&mdash;that you have so deeply
injured me,&mdash;is that not enough to gloat over?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant Pierre stared. The meaning of the words
came to him with a relish. Haganè really believed this
thing; then of course he suffered! Very good! A look of
malignant triumph grew in Pierre&#39;s face. Haganè drank the
bitterness with his eyes. Here, at last, thought Pierre, was
the undipped heel, the pervious crown. Yuki&#39;s body sagged
an inch. Pierre stooped to it. Again she was in his arms,
and he devoured, with despairing looks, the small, dead
face.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè, by a fierce gesture, commanded Onda to be still.
Todd felt his heart stop, then rise slowly to his throat, and
Ronsard, shivering, gripped the American&#39;s arm. The moon
sailed full into a cloudless sky. Beneath it the great tragedy
lay bare.</p>

<p class="indent">The trend of Pierre&#39;s thoughts at this moment he could
never afterward recall. His flesh felt as though it melted
from him. His brain stirred and pulled at possibilities before
unfelt. Voices not of earth said strange things which he
almost understood. Yuki&#39;s dead smile changed. He saw
her lips quiver. Her white face grew to one still prayer.
Something like a cooling fluid went into his hot and empty
veins. He felt strong again and noble. He regarded Yuki&#39;s
accuser with a new look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You lie in saying that thing, Haganè. Is it not enough
that you have used, and then slain her, that you now traduce
her name? No, you dare not resent my words, coward,
liar, slanderer! What is the theft of a paper compared to
this? For Yuki&#39;s sake, I tell you that no flower hidden in
green leaves, no girl-child at its mother&#39;s breast, no flake of
snow, new-fallen, is purer than this woman. Yes, grin now
and tremble!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He went swiftly to the stricken man, and dealt him a blow
upon the lips.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>[pg&nbsp;423]</span>
With gasps of horror the others rushed in. Haganè caught
Pierre to his side, and fought off the frenzied Onda. &quot;Back,
all of you, stand off, I say!&quot; he thundered. &quot;The man gives
me life. Let him strike. Yes, yes,&quot; he cried to Pierre, all
the hauteur and the terrible bronze composure melted in this
new fierce joy; &quot;tear my eyes from their sockets, my tongue
from its base,&mdash;only repeat that she is pure! How could I
know? She let me think it,&mdash;your boasts, the broken hairpin!
Did she not give you the pledge of the hairpin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took it myself,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;and would not give it
back, though she pleaded. How could I guess the gross sentiment
that is attached to the silly business by such minds as
yours? She was pure, I say; give me her body and let me
go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè followed him to the kuruma. He stretched out
both hands, now as one entreating mercy. &quot;Poor boy, bound
with me on the wheel of fate, listen just a little, if you can
command your strength. She shielded you. Then, with her
life, she rebought the paper. When you had offered to give
it back, if I would consent to the restitution of her wifehood,
I asked her if she was worthy to return, and in her conscious
innocence, she gave the answer, &#39;No.&#39; She thought only of
the unworthiness of weakness&mdash;she whose soul, diluted into
eternity, might stock a Christian heaven. In her self-death,
she deliberately let me believe her evil, that her atonement
might have this added bitterness. Also she may have feared
that, being undeceived, I might falter in my promise not to
restrain her from expiation. She knew of my love, and we
have pledged ourselves to reunion and joint service after
death. You cannot understand these things, Monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; said Pierre, in bewilderment, putting his hand to
his forehead, &quot;I cannot understand, of course; she was
always saying that. I cannot understand, but something
whispers&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur,&quot; cried Haganè, &quot;I am an older, graver man.
I have suffered as I think you cannot suffer. Give me back
the boon of her body!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre blinked and wavered in the path. These sudden
shifting currents of purpose dazed him. The strain was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>[pg&nbsp;424]</span>
tightening again, and he felt the premonitory breath of fever.
He grasped outward into the air. He looked at Yuki, as if
for the first time, and moved dumb lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You believed this of your wife, yet forgave&mdash;helped&mdash;loved
her&mdash;You look forward to having her as your wife in
a coming re-birth?&quot; asked Todd, wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had it been true, it was but sin of the flesh. By death
and expiation, she would have cleansed it. The soul would
have risen, free.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mon Dieu, what people!&quot; gasped Ronsard. &quot;There
stands the man Onda, scowling at us all,&mdash;and not even resenting,
from Haganè, his only daughter&#39;s death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Onda will sacrifice to the Gods in gratitude when he
knows the whole,&quot; said Haganè.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre was trying to speak. He vacillated, soul and body,
between the dead woman and her husband. &quot;Do not refuse
me,&quot; murmured Haganè, stepping nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">Pierre did not shrink. Instead, he, too, went near, as if
fascinated. He cleared his throat, pushed back the damp
hair from his girlish forehead, and smiled up at the dark,
eager face. &quot;Haganè is a great man,&quot; he said, tapping the
other&#39;s arm. &quot;Oh, he is a terrible man! I can refuse him
nothing. Yuki says that the Gods of this land speak with
him. I believe it. One is standing just behind him now;
that is a terrible God, too. He looks like Haganè. He sits
like a white flint in a ball of fire. On his arms are the coils
of rope that bind the passions; in his right hand is the
wheel of fate. No, I will not refuse. Old God must have
flowers on his altar. Take white flower, old War God.
There she is,&mdash;my love&mdash;my darling. If only she would
not smile!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè caught the boy as he fell, transferring the burden
quickly to Ronsard&#39;s outstretched arms. He gazed then anew
at the face of his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yuki,&quot; he said, as if to her listening spirit, &quot;you are soul
of my soul through ten thousand lives. I let you die. It was
karma. A flower! A flower! Alas, that a flower should be
stung by immortality!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get her away, your Highness, before we call the servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>[pg&nbsp;425]</span>
and a doctor for Le Beau,&quot; whispered Todd, after an agonizing
interval. Haganè rose from his knees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, little Yuki must go with me,&quot; he muttered; &quot;I will
take her at once, your Excellency.&quot; He went toward the
coolie hat and stooped. Onda was before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not seemly, Lord, for you to bear so foul a burden.
I will wear the hat, and I pray you take these shoes of mine,
giving me the straw sandals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè obeyed passively, his eyes fixed always on Yuki&#39;s
moonlit face. Now and again he felt in the bosom of his
robe for the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Loosen the robe from your girdle, Master,&quot; pleaded the
kerai.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè did so, releasing the caught-up ends. The long,
dark garment, though of cotton, restored to him the height
and dignity of his usual presence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I draw the hood of the kuruma?&quot; asked Onda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, cover her face,&mdash;her small white face; the very
night may weep and falter at that smile.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Onda tucked up his robe, put on the wide hat and the straw
sandals, placed himself between the shafts, and started along
the driveway.</p>

<p class="indent">Haganè, moving always slowly, abstractedly, folded his
arms, bowed his head, and followed in the attitude of a
mourner immediately behind the covered vehicle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take my burden for a moment,&quot; pleaded Ronsard, when
the sound of wheels had quite died away. &quot;I can support&mdash;no
longer. Let me summon aid. Mon Dieu! this night has
made of me an old man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has made of me a prophet,&quot; said Todd, &quot;for I have met
Immortals face to face.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> sumptuous obsequies of the young Princess Haganè,
become so suddenly and so securely a leading figure in Tokio&#39;s
official life; her mysterious death (heart failure, the obliging
papers called it); Haganè&#39;s immediate departure for the seat
of war; Pierre Le Beau&#39;s re-capture and long, desperate illness
(with relapses brought on by further crafty flights, terminating
always in a certain hillside grave),&mdash;these events
co-existent, co-related, formed, inevitably, dazzling bits of
speculation pieceable together into various strange patterns.</p>

<p class="indent">Outwardly the tragedy was as free from suspicion as any
such shocking occurrence well could be. The funeral, in
deference to Yuki&#39;s Christian conversion, was held in the
little American Episcopal chapel in Tsukijii, Tokio; the
American Bishop, assisted by members of the native clergy,
conducting the ceremony in Japanese. Haganè, ponderous,
brooding, and self-contained, had walked immediately behind
the flower-laden burden. The scowling Tetsujo, with Iriya,
followed him. Suzumè was there, alone, for she had refused
the petition of Maru San. Next to the family came Gwendolen,
shivering, slender, wound in crêpe, on the arm of Mr.
Dodge. Behind her walked Cyrus Todd and Mrs. Todd, both
in mourning.</p>

<p class="indent">The strained decorum of the crowded congregation was
threatened twice; first, when old Suzumè, bearing a sprig of
the mystic mochi tree, tottered up the aisle, and began praying
aloud to the black thing into which her nursling had been
nailed; and later, just after the words of the Bishop, &quot;I am
the Resurrection and the Life,&quot; when Gwendolen fainted
quietly away.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">After the prescribed nine days of gossip and conjecture, ill-natured
ones turned their eyes to the Todds, and chiefly to
Gwendolen. The deep withdrawal of the two ladies from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[pg&nbsp;427]</span>
social world of Tokio, the mourning garments worn by them,
were interpreted by some observers as mere stinginess, an
excuse to abstain from lavish Legation hospitality; but by
a larger number as &quot;bids&quot; for Japanese popularity. Also
many of the fair sex among European Legations declared
(Mon Dieu! it was obvious!) that Gwendolen had seized upon
this dank method for the securing of Dodge,&mdash;the young
American attaché known to be so madly in love with Carmen
Gil y Niestra. Gwendolen&#39;s ever-growing intimacy with Iriya
Onda, and the pathetic content shown by the elder woman in
the company of her dead child&#39;s closest friend, were charged
to the columns of the former category. &quot;The Hawk&#39;s Eye&quot;
expatiated upon these congenial themes. The Misses Stunt
gave an afternoon tea with all of the catering done in
Yokohama.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Later on, when cherry-blossoms covered the whole land
in a perfumed glory, Mrs. Todd answered timidly by a
bunch of artificial violets on her spring bonnet. Gwendolen
still kept to simple black, and it was averred that she did
so knowing how marvellously it contrasted with the pearly
tints of her flesh and the nervous gold tendrils of her hair.
Never had Gwendolen been more beautiful nor, in a strange,
deep, half-comprehending way, more tranquilly happy. The
light of heroism had come too near ever quite to fade.
Love, also, had come, and on the very wings of despair.
Yet, behind these facts, was a something unspeakable, precious,
vague,&mdash;a something apprehended by Dodge also.
Even as the two happy ones stood together with eyes looking
level toward vistas of almost certain human joy, each
felt that compared with the passion of the two immortals,
now gone from their lives, this rapture was like the glad
hearts of children. Often they spoke of Yuki and her husband.
&quot;Oh, but they knew that they were to meet,&quot; Gwendolen
had cried again and again. &quot;Yuki is with him now,&mdash;and
after this war, after his last duty to his country and
to his Emperor,&mdash;they will find each other!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of poor Pierre, after his departure for France accompanied
by Count Ronsard, none of the Todd household ever spoke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>[pg&nbsp;428]</span>
Once, some months after the return of the latter to Tokio,
Mrs. Todd, in a hushed whisper, as if she were guilty of an
indiscretion, asked a single question. The answer was as
brief and furtive. In a certain sense it relieved the conscience
of the interlocutrix, while it shadowed her complacency.
Neither question nor answer was ever retailed to
Gwendolen.</p>

<p class="indent">But all this came much later. The spring immediately
following Yuki&#39;s death went by in a shimmer of winds,
scurrying clouds, and whirling petals. Summer smiled her
deeper green in rice-fields under the glint and blur of rain.
Then, like a stately deity for whose feet the shining carpet
had been spread, a golden autumn came.</p>

<p class="indent">On the hills vermilion maples burned, each leaf so deeply
dyed that its shadow on the sand was red. Hedges of dodan
ruled fiery angles over the green lines that summer had drawn.
Small carts, man-pulled, with pots of sunny, stiff chrysanthemums,
crawled in by dewy morning lanes toward the focus
of the capital. Harvesting of grain began, and, presiding
over it, the deity of a large, slow moon. In suburban districts
the people held festivals and made offerings of tea,
vegetables, and money to Inari Sama and her two lean fox-spirits,
for the slaying of rice-insects, demanded by the
summer&#39;s agricultural toil.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Meantime war had raged on land and sea. The slopes of
Port Arthur had been drenched already in insufficient blood.
Great battles on the Yalu, epoch-making in enormity and
heroism, had been not quite great enough. The Russians,
always strongly fortified, numbering always more than the
army of their opponents, were able to keep decisive ruin
for themselves at bay. The Japanese people did not know
a wavering strand of faith. They believed always in their
ultimate victory. Each hero, checked in his duty by Russian
steel, became on the instant a flaming spirit of war. The
mangled body might be tucked away in Manchurian clay, or
sent, as a sacred relic, to the beloved homeland; but the freed
spirit hung about its brethren, and fought with invincible
weapons for the common cause. The women of Japan worked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>[pg&nbsp;429]</span>
indefatigably. Few lamentations rose from them. They
would have considered tears disloyal. The Emperor, behind
his gray moat-walls,&mdash;half man, half God to them,&mdash;sent
down his heart among the people. His was the suffering
and the loss,&mdash;and victory, when it came, was to be his.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Late in October, at the American Legation, the doors once
more stood wide. Pots of chrysanthemums in full bloom
crowded near the entrance, and climbed, in groups of two
and three, the edges of the stone steps, as if leading a golden
invitation. Gwendolen, that morning, standing among them,
had dwelt in thought upon another time, scarcely a year past,
when she and Yuki had laughed together among such shaggy
blooms, when their hands had been tinctured by the stems
of them and the air of long reception-rooms flooded with the
medicinal fragrance. She did not weep, only stretched her
arms outward, whispering, &quot;Yuki, Yuki,&mdash;I know you are
with him; but just this one day,&mdash;my wedding-day,&mdash;come
back to me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The marriage ceremony was to take place in the drawing-room.
After a luncheon to a score or more of intimate
friends, the young couple were to go for a quiet sojourn to
Nara. This was the first occasion since Yuki&#39;s death that
the American girl had worn a color. At the appointed hour
she stood within the green-hung window recess like an Easter
lily, all white and gold,&mdash;a broad white cloth hat, touched
with knots of amber. The silent little wedding company
drew close. The Bishop cleared his throat professionally.
One heard the words, &quot;Dearly Beloved&quot; before he uttered
them. At that moment, a bird, attracted maybe by the tall
white flower within, flew straight against the pane, and beat
against it with fluttering wings. Gwendolen looked up
quickly. Her lips moved. &quot;Yuki! Yuki! is it you?&quot; she
was saying. Dodge pressed tightly the arm within his own.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of strong efforts on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Todd
to be at ease, a vague mist of sadness floated in the wide
rooms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s something awfully doleful about things here,&quot;
confided a guest to the ubiquitous Mrs. Stunt.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>[pg&nbsp;430]</span>
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s that Haganè woman who died&mdash;or was murdered
in her bed&mdash;last spring. The Legation has been about as
cheerful as a morgue ever since. Very inconsiderate to us
Americans, I take it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Todd saw the faces of the whisperers, and could guess
the trend of their words. He shook himself together, and
swore that in some way he would manage to dispel the
gathering gloom. Now he rushed from one guest to another,
his dry wit and quaint remarks soon attracting general attention.
Dodge understood, and seconded him with zest. Mrs.
Todd stopped the sniffling she had just begun, and produced
a diluted smile; the company, catching the infection, tumbled,
one over the heels of another, in the race for a precarious
joy. The rooms began to echo laughter,&mdash;servants smiled
as they stole about. A twig of mistletoe, sent all the way
from North Carolina, was discovered hanging from the tongue
of the floral bell. Kissing of the bride was attempted, and
the time-worn jests, pertinent to the occasion, indulged in up
to the point of friction.</p>

<p class="indent">It was at last a company of real wedding guests that
took places at the table. Japanese flower symbols of wedded
bliss touched elbows with still American vases jammed thick
with stemless flowers. The favors were chrysanthemums in
enamel, gold, and topaz. Todd saw that the champagne was
not delayed. He knew the potency to scatter thought sent
up by those springing globules of mirth. &quot;Fill,&mdash;all!&quot; he
cried, standing, &quot;a toast, a toast to the bride!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Laughing faces turned as one toward Gwendolen, enthroned
in a great teakwood chair. She flushed to a rose, under the
big hat, but murmured, so that her words could be heard,&mdash;&quot;I
accept, and drink with you,&mdash;against precedent!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the others lifted brittle stems, she, emptying swiftly
the sunny fluid, poured a little water into her glass. The
drinking of water as a pledge is used between Japanese as
a token of death, of love, in death and beyond it. Dodge,
his bright eyes swimming in tenderness, did as she had done.
While the company drained the conventional felicity,&mdash;this
young couple, in silence, unnoticed by those who crowded
most closely, drank the pledge of love and loyalty to Yuki&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>[pg&nbsp;431]</span>
freed spirit. Had it been possible for any face to be more
beautiful than Gwendolen&#39;s, she&mdash;on catching sight of her
husband as the water touched his lips&mdash;now outrivalled
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">Todd had seen but could not join them. He was self-constituted
master of ceremonies. &quot;Next, my new son, Mr.
Dodge!&quot; he cried aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hear! hear!&quot; clamored the company.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And next,&quot; said Todd, &quot;to that great man, the Japanese
Emperor!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Emperor, the Emperor!&quot; ejaculated Dodge, with
such vehemence that the assembly had to join or be deafened.
&quot;Banzai Nippon!&quot; roared Dodge. &quot;Banzai Nippon!&quot;
vociferated Todd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Banzai Nippon!&quot; the servants echoed in excited underbreaths
as they hurried back to pantry and kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Banzai Nippon!&quot; cried the waiting betto and the kuruma
men outside, at first hint of the call.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Banthai Nip-pon!&quot; lisped the the cook&#39;s baby, who sat
well under the kitchen-table to escape being trod upon, and
scraped out a foreign cake-bowl with a single chopstick.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">But Yuki&mdash;a snowflake fallen on the windy slope of
Aoyama&mdash;slept on, smiling, with Haganè&#39;s dagger in her
heart; and on a rocky promontory across from the impregnable
fortress of Liau Tung, a grim, quiet warrior sat alone, with
field-glasses dangling limply from his hands, and eyes that
saw only a white, white face upturned to his, and lips that
murmured, &quot;I know you now, my husband,&mdash;and shall wait!
Banzai Nippon!&quot; while the cold steel crept nearer to a warm
and shrinking heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Banzai Nippon!</p>
